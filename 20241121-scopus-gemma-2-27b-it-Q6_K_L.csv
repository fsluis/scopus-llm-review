The purpose of this work is to analyze the economic, social and environmental sustainability of the livestock sector from the 19th century, according to what has been exposed in the national historiography. The research was done with the qualitative approach and documentary design. The analytical-synthetic method was used. The method of analysis was heuristic, which allows finding new knowledge from historical aspects. The method of synthesis was hermeneuttical. The sources were secondary. The mechanism for collecting information was through a bibliographic record. Information retrieval was done through hermeneutic interpretation. The results indicate that livestock activity in Colombia has not been socially or environmentally sustainable, which is reflected in the negative impact of the activity on peasant communities and the natural world. It has been economically sustainable for the livestock entrepreneur, although the rate of return has different views among the authors.

While the reference paper focuses on the sustainability of the Colombian livestock sector from a historical perspective, it touches upon the social and environmental impacts of this industry.  

Here's how it *could* be potentially useful:

* **Contextual Background:** The paper could provide historical context for the challenges of achieving sustainable consumption practices within a specific industry. You could briefly mention the Colombian livestock example to illustrate the long-standing complexities surrounding sustainability.
* **Illustrative Example:** The paper's findings on the negative social and environmental impacts of unsustainable livestock practices could serve as a real-world example to support your argument about the importance of accessible information for responsible consumption.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Limited Direct Relevance:** The reference paper doesn't directly address information-seeking processes, information availability, or information asymmetries, which are the core focus of your research. 
* **Geographic Specificity:** The Colombian context might not be directly transferable to other regions or consumption contexts.

**Recommendation:**

Use the reference paper cautiously and selectively. It could offer some valuable context or illustrative examples, but it shouldn't be a central pillar of your argument."

However, persistent barriers hinder many consumers from transitioning to the legal market, necessitating a nuanced understanding of their behaviors for targeted policy interventions. This study aims to improve understanding of cannabis consumers’ unregulated purchase decisions in British Columbia (B.C.), and to explore motivational factors for transitioning to the legal market. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with cannabis consumers in B.C., who were at least 19 years old and purchased some or all of their cannabis through unregulated sources. Interviews were transcribed and an inductive thematic analysis was conducted using NVivo. Through coding iterations, we moved from descriptive to analytic codes, and finally mapped the codes to themes aligned with the Five Stages of Consumer Decision Making model. Results: Participants (N = 31) represented a broad range of demographic characteristics (i.e., gender, age, education, income). Four themes were identified: seeking information, evaluation of alternatives, purchase decision, and post purchase evaluation. Despite purchasing all or some of their cannabis from the unregulated market, most participants were supportive of legalization and felt that legal cannabis is safe, accessible, and of reasonable quality. However, several barriers prevent consumers from regularly accessing the regulated market, including: price, lack of sales and promotions, potency, limited product variety, and inadequate product interaction. Conclusion: This study delineates barriers that obstruct consumers' transition to the regulated market. These findings, aligned with considerations for public health and safety, offer valuable insights to inform cannabis policy and promote a more effective and consumer-oriented regulatory framework. © 2024",Cannabis; Cannabis sourcing; Unregulated drug market,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85207969113,Possibly,"Information seeking, availability","
While the reference paper focuses on cannabis consumption rather than broader sustainable or ethical consumption, it offers valuable insights into consumer information-seeking behaviors and the barriers they face when making purchasing decisions.  

Here's how you could potentially utilize this paper:

* **Information Seeking Challenges:** The paper highlights specific challenges consumers face in accessing information about the regulated cannabis market (price, lack of promotions, limited variety, etc.). You could draw parallels to these challenges in the context of sustainable or ethical consumption. For example, are there similar information barriers preventing consumers from accessing information about the ethical sourcing or environmental impact of products?
* **Influence of Information Availability:** The study demonstrates how limited information availability can hinder consumers from making choices aligned with their preferences (in this case, transitioning to the legal market). This supports your argument about the importance of accessible and transparent information in driving responsible consumption. You could cite this paper as evidence that information barriers can have a tangible impact on consumer behavior.
* **Qualitative Insights:** The paper's qualitative approach (interviews) provides rich insights into consumer motivations and decision-making processes. While the context is different, the methodology could inspire your own research. You might consider using similar qualitative methods to explore consumer perspectives on information seeking related to sustainable or ethical consumption.


**Important Note:**

It's crucial to acknowledge the limitations of applying findings from the cannabis market to broader sustainable consumption. The context is specific, and consumer motivations may differ significantly. However, the paper can still offer valuable insights into information-seeking behaviors and the impact of information availability on consumer choices."

However, in practice, ecolabels may not always comply with legal requirements in terms of reliability, accuracy and clarity, and sometimes deliberately mislead the consumer. In Russia and many other developing countries, the problem of inaccurate information on the environmental properties of goods and services is still not recognized. The only regulatory document that currently defines the basic principles for developing and using environmental labels and declarations is the national versions of international standards ISO 14020/14021/14024/14025-Environmental Labels Package. This paper contributes to the literature in two main dimensions. It assesses the degree of prevalence of ecolabeling in the Russian market of everyday goods and the reliability and informational content of frequently used labels (supply-side research). Second, it estimates the consumers’ awareness and reaction to ecolabeled products (demand-side research). The most obvious finding to emerge from this study is that low consumer awareness keeps the level of greenwashing low, but at the same time does not stimulate eco-innovations. We suggest developing smartphone applications that allow buyers to check the compliance of ecolabels on a product with ISO standards directly during the shopping process. We propose to use this approach as a cost-effective and straightforward way to simultaneously raise consumer awareness of ecolabeling and reduce the likelihood of greenwashing. © 2021 by the authors.

Following the Paris accord, the EU has undertaken several initiatives to regulate the private sector activities among which the EU taxonomy. The taxonomy aims at directing private finance investments by providing a classification system establishing a list of environmentally sustainable economic activities. The question this paper aims to address is what are the implications of regulation of finance and investments for companies in the building and real estate sector? Drawing on institutional theory, focusing on legitimacy, we follow the process of introducing the taxonomy within three companies – a contractor, a real estate company, and a consulting engineering company – to identify the changes the taxonomy can introduce in their business. Keeping in mind that establishing the regulation and the taxonomy is a compromise between politicians, industry lobbyists’ interventions, and technical experts’ advices, the proposed solutions may not be able to achieve the aforementioned goals. The cases were selected as possible forerunners of the impact of the taxonomy in Sweden. Two of the companies, a contractor and a real estate company, engaged recently in systematizing their measures, documenting their climate impact, and establishing strategic goals for reduction of energy and material consumption. The third, a consulting engineer company, has so far felt comfortable doing progressive statements. The extra effort of establishing documentation was carried out within 3 years during which the companies have had an unusually good economy. The analysis shows that the taxonomy is not demanding enough to provide the needed push for living up to the Paris accord and consequently risks becoming a publicly sanctioned greenwashing.

In doing so, it contributes to SDGs 11, 12, and 13. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Institutional theory; Legitimacy; Sustainable finance; Sweden; Taxonomy,,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85172171261,Possibly,"Asymmetries, Sustainability","
While the reference paper focuses on the building sector and the EU Taxonomy, it touches upon elements relevant to your research:

* **Information Asymmetries:** The paper highlights the potential for greenwashing due to the taxonomy not being demanding enough. This aligns with your interest in information asymmetries and how they can mislead consumers about the true sustainability of products or practices. You could cite this paper to support your argument about the importance of transparent and accessible information to counter greenwashing and empower consumers to make informed decisions.

* **Sustainability:** The paper emphasizes the need for stronger regulations and a more robust taxonomy to drive genuine sustainability in the construction sector. This connects to your broader theme of responsible consumption, as sustainable practices are a key aspect of responsible decision-making. You could use this paper to contextualize your findings within a larger discussion about the systemic challenges to achieving sustainable consumption patterns.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Sector Specificity:** The reference paper is highly focused on the building sector. While the concepts of greenwashing and information asymmetry are transferable, be cautious about directly applying their findings to other consumption contexts without further analysis.
* **Limited Focus on Information Seeking:** The paper doesn't directly address consumer information-seeking behaviors, which is a central focus of your research. Its value lies more in highlighting the broader context of information availability and potential manipulation.

It is expanding opportunities for consumers to preserve the ecosystem throughout the whole product lifecycle. Drawing from extant rational and moral theories in behavior change, this research extends the understanding of consumer involvement in the circular economy by investigating whether being exposed to “green” clues can trigger additional information seeking and be empowering to people to contribute to the circular economy. In contrast to some prior research that suggests that information can overload consumers, this research finds that these “green” clues can stimulate greater information seeking, which can make the consumer feel more capable of effecting change through circular economy consumption. This study draws a conceptual model for behavioral change, tested on a representative sample of 4161 individuals across the five largest European countries. Results show that external “green” clues prompt consumers' information search on product lifecycle and ultimately make them feel empowered to contribute to the circular economy.

Here's how you could potentially utilize this reference:

* **Comparative Context:** You could use this paper to provide a broader context for your research by highlighting how information-seeking influences decision-making in general, not just within the realm of responsible consumption. This can help demonstrate the broader significance of your findings.
* **Methodological Insights:** The reference paper mentions using a national survey with face-to-face interviews. Depending on your methodology, you could draw inspiration from their approach or contrast it with your own.
* **Limitations Discussion:** You could use this paper to discuss the limitations of solely focusing on efficiency in decision-making. Your paper emphasizes the ethical and social aspects of consumption, which the reference paper doesn't fully address. This contrast can strengthen your argument for the importance of considering these broader dimensions.

**Important Note:**

The reference paper's primary focus is on consumer efficiency in a social commerce setting, which is not directly aligned with your research on responsible consumption. Therefore, its relevance is limited. Use it cautiously and primarily as a source of comparative context or methodological insights rather than a core supporting reference."

The ability to shift consumption towards less popular content and towards content different from user's typical historic tastes not only affords the platform ways of handling issues such as filter bubbles and popularity bias, but also contributes to maintaining a healthy and sustainable consumption patterns necessary for overall platform success. In this work, we view diversity as an enabler for shifting consumption and consider two notions of music diversity, based on taste similarity and popularity, and investigate how four different recommendation approaches optimized for user satisfaction, fare on diversity metrics. To investigate how the ranker complexity influences diversity, we use two well-known rankers and propose two new models of increased complexity: a feedback aware neural ranker and a reinforcement learning (RL) based ranker. We demonstrate that our models lead to gains in satisfaction, but at the cost of diversity. Such trade-off between model complexity and diversity necessitates the need for explicitly encoding diversity in the modeling process, for which we consider four types of approaches: interleaving based, submodularity based, interpolation, and RL reward modeling based. We find that our reward modeling based RL approach achieves the best trade-off between optimizing the satisfaction metric and surfacing diverse content, thereby enabling consumption shifting at scale. Our findings have implications for the design and deployment of practical approaches for music diversification, which we discuss at length. © 2021 ACM.",diversity; music; recommender systems; shifting consumption,Economic and social effects; Filtration; Information retrieval; Reinforcement learning; Websites; Algorithmic model; Diversity metrics; Model complexity; Model-based OPC; Modeling process; Music streaming; Sustainable consumption; User satisfaction; Data mining,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103012766,Possibly,Other,"
While the reference paper focuses on music streaming and diversity, it touches upon a relevant concept: **the influence of algorithmic recommendations on consumption patterns.**  

Here's how it could be potentially useful:

* **Analogical Reasoning:** You could draw parallels between the way algorithms shape music consumption and how information systems (like product recommendations, labeling schemes, etc.) influence responsible consumption choices.  
* **Highlighting Information Barriers:** The paper discusses how algorithms can create ""filter bubbles"" and reinforce existing preferences. This concept aligns with your interest in information barriers and how they can hinder consumers from considering ethically responsible options.
* **Discussing Algorithmic Transparency:** The reference paper explores different recommendation approaches, some more complex than others. This could spark a discussion in your paper about the need for transparency in information systems related to responsible consumption. Are complex algorithms understandable to consumers? Do they inadvertently obscure ethical considerations?

**Important Note:** The reference paper's primary focus is not on sustainability or responsible consumption. Therefore, its relevance is indirect and would require careful contextualization within your own research."

Yet empirical evidence about the sustainable behaviours domain through which Gen Z outperforms elderly generations, and whether digital tools interplay as concrete enablers, is still scant. Hence, drawing on the Generational Cohort Theory, the study has a twofold objective: first, it compares differences between Gen Z and older people over a set of private and public sustainable behaviours; second, it indulges in the role of information seeking and sharing, exploring whether it impacts on sustainable consumption choices as the generation varies. We designed a quantitative empirical analysis, administering an online survey to a representative sample of the Italian population (n = 1,029). Through t-test analysis, we assessed the differences in the abovementioned behaviours between Gen Z and the elderly cohort. Then, multivariate regression analyses allowed us to explore the impact of information and generations on sustainable habits. Findings suggested that elderly generations succeed in household efficient resource consumption, reducing waste and recycling. On the other side, Gen Z favours using new consumption models based on sharing economy, dealing with online information, and being an active citizen. Furthermore, information seeking and social sharing foster both young and elderly generations to perform virtuous behaviours and sustainable consumption.

This paper is relevant to your research in a couple of key ways:

* **Information Seeking and Sustainable Consumption:** The reference paper directly investigates the role of information seeking in shaping sustainable consumption behaviors, particularly among Gen Z. This aligns with your focus on information-seeking processes and their influence on responsible consumption. You could cite this paper to support your argument that information seeking is a crucial factor in driving responsible choices.
* **Generational Differences:** The paper highlights differences in information-seeking behaviors and sustainable practices between Gen Z and older generations. This could be valuable context for your own research, especially if you are examining a specific age group or considering generational variations in information use and ethical consumption.

**How to Utilize:**

1. **Support your claims:** Use the findings from this paper to bolster your arguments about the importance of information seeking in responsible consumption.

2. **Provide context:** Discuss the generational differences in information seeking and sustainable practices highlighted in the paper to add nuance to your analysis.

This paper argues that providing more transparency regarding green supply chains (GSCs) through eco-labels (such as Cradle to Cradle Certified®) is critical for creating trust and convincing consumers to buy eco-products over conventional ones. Building on previous literature related to sustainable consumption behavior, green purchasing behavior, Cradle to Cradle certification and GSC management, we develop and test a conceptual model to empirically investigate the links between consumers' trust in eco-product labels and GSC perceptions in influencing green purchase behavior (GPB) in the case of eco-friendly fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs). By studying a sample of 276 German consumers and applying structural equation modeling, we find that the trust in eco-product labels and positive perceptions of GSCs are important drivers of GPB. Our research contributes by expanding the knowledge on the factors influencing the acceptance of eco-products, highlighting the importance of supply chain transparency and trust in GSCs among consumers.

This paper is relevant to your research in two key ways:

1. **Information Availability:** The reference paper directly addresses the influence of information availability on responsible consumption. It argues that providing transparent information about green supply chains (GSCs) through eco-labels like Cradle to Cradle Certified® can increase consumer trust and drive purchases of eco-friendly products. This aligns with your focus on how accessible and transparent information can shape the prioritization of responsible aspects during decision-making.

2. **Information Asymmetries:** The paper highlights the issue of greenwashing, where uncertified eco-labels can mislead consumers. This points to an information asymmetry between companies (who may engage in greenwashing) and consumers (who lack the information to discern genuine sustainability efforts). Your research also touches on information barriers, which can be seen as a manifestation of such asymmetries.

**How to Utilize:**

* **Support your arguments:** You can cite this paper to support your claims about the importance of information availability and transparency in fostering responsible consumption.
* **Expand on information asymmetries:**  The reference paper's discussion of greenwashing can enrich your analysis of information barriers. You could explore how greenwashing practices contribute to these barriers and hinder consumers' ability to make informed decisions.
* **Contrast approaches:** While your paper focuses on broader information-seeking processes, the reference paper provides a specific example of how information transparency through eco-labels can impact consumer behavior. You could contrast these approaches and discuss the potential benefits and limitations of each.

The research design incorporates an inductive qualitative approach to investigate environmental awareness and attitudes toward ecologically friendly behaviors. Six FGIs (Focus Group Interviews) were conducted across three European regions, involving participants from diverse age groups (20–39 years and 40–60 years) in each region. The study shows that ecological awareness varies between countries and generations, reflecting distinctive environmental strategies shaped by cultural and developmental factors. Participants in each region and age group exhibit diverse levels of engagement in sustainable activities, and highlight issues such as the need for tailored strategies, concerns related to eco-labelling, greenwashing, and inadequate waste treatment, as well as information gaps. These variations in pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors across age groups and regions underscore the need for tailored strategies and regional policies.

The findings of the SLR indicate that consumers’ decision-making process is primarily driven by socio-psychological stimuli, such as environmental concern, health consciousness, and social norms. These stimuli trigger internal states in consumers, which consist of cognitive and affective states. The internal states are represented by facilitators, such as attitude towards green cosmetics, perceived product quality, and product knowledge, as well as inhibitors, such as perceived high price, skepticism, and greenwashing. Among the final responses, purchase intention was found to be the most detected in the reviewed studies.

The purpose of this study is to analyse the perception of greenwashing in fast-fashion brands' sustainable communication and to identify its link to consumers' sustainable behaviour and attitudes. An analysis was conducted on five fast-fashion leading brands, based on a non-experimental cross-sectional analytical design and using an online survey. Research results show that consumers perceive greenwashing in the communication of all fast-fashion brands. Furthermore, the perception of greenwashing is higher when it is associated with the search for information on sustainable fashion, as well as the purchase of sustainable fashion. The study also concludes that the perception of greenwashing increases when fast fashion brands carry out advertising campaigns or disseminate their sustainability content through influencers or on their websites. © 2024 The Author(s).

The research design follows a three-stage analytical procedure. First, we critically review the main concepts and vocabularies used in the field and propose a framework that organizes existing studies into four major types according to their approaches and focus: gap prediction, willingness ‘to go responsible’, gap understanding and barriers to SRC. Second, a qualitative content analysis provided a set of words and semantic categories for text searches in bibliographic databases. Findings showed that the Anglo-Saxon countries lead the field, and that patterns are changing, such as the rise of China as a contributor. Finally, a bibliometric analysis of 3,367 articles, retrieved from the Scopus and Web of Science databases, identified the intellectual structure of the SRC gap literature, top contributors (countries, publications and authors), mature and emerging themes and the main barriers to SRC adoption. The 25 top journals published almost 50% of the articles and citations. The International Journal of Consumer Studies (IJCS) stands out as the only journal focused on consumer behaviour among the most prolific publications in the SRC gap literature. This finding makes the IJCS the benchmark for researchers in the field. The SRC gap research addresses five domains: clean energy, biodiversity, public safety, food-related issues and consumer marketing research. These domains share six reasons for the SRC gaps: economic and financial factors, information and knowledge barriers, sense of effort, lack of feelings of responsibility, contextual and social factors and supply aspects. Overall, this study provides clarity into the relevant literature that helps the SRC gaps’ understanding and identifies directions for future research. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",attitude-behaviour gap; bibliometric; consumer behaviour; content analysis; literature review; socially responsible consumption; sustainability science,,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85127543045,Yes,"Availability, Sustainability","

Over the past decade, public demand for information on sustainable consumption choices has increased. Meanwhile, development and expansion of the life cycle assessment literature has improved scientific evidence on supply chain impacts on the environment. However, data gaps and biases lead to uncertainty and undermine development of effective impact mitigation actions or behavior change policies. This study evaluates whether scientific research into the nature-related impacts of agri-food systems aligns with the needs of the public, as indicated by patterns of information seeking. We compare the relative volume of public Google queries to scientific articles related to agri-food systems and three major impacts: chemical pollution, greenhouse gas emissions or biodiversity loss. We discover that biodiversity is systematically overlooked in scientific studies on agri-food system impacts in favor of research on emissions and to a lesser extent chemical impacts. In contrast, total relative volumes of public queries on agri-food systems and biodiversity equal those for emissions impacts at global and Australian scales. Public interest in biodiversity impacts of agri-food systems increased significantly between 2009 and 2019, despite no significant change in the relative volume of biodiversity-focused scientific articles. Global public attention on chemical impacts declined significantly over this time period, with no significant change in the relative representation of this topic in scientific outputs. We recommend strategic investment into the biodiversity impacts of agri-food systems to build a knowledge base that allows the public to learn about the impacts of their choices and be inspired to change to more sustainable behaviors. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Japan KK part of Springer Nature.",Agriculture; Biodiversity conservation; Climate change; Food consumption and production; Organic food; Sustainability,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100904063,Possibly,Information seeking,"
While the reference paper focuses on the *supply side* of information (scientific research output) and its alignment with *public* information seeking, it offers valuable insights that can be indirectly relevant to your study. Here's how:

* **Highlighting Information Gaps:** The paper reveals a discrepancy between public interest in biodiversity impacts of food and the relative scarcity of scientific research on this topic. This finding can support your argument about information barriers and the need for improved information systems. You could cite this paper to illustrate how even when consumers are interested in specific ethical aspects (like biodiversity), they may face a lack of accessible and transparent information.
* **Framing the Discussion:** The paper's focus on the alignment (or misalignment) between scientific research and public information needs can provide a useful framework for discussing the broader issue of information access in the context of responsible consumption. You could draw parallels between the public's desire for information on biodiversity impacts and consumers' need for information on other ethical aspects, such as fair labor practices or product origin.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Direct Applicability:**  Keep in mind that the reference paper doesn't directly address consumer decision-making processes or the influence of information on ethical consumption choices, which are the core focus of your study.
* **Scope:** The paper's scope is limited to food and its environmental impacts. While this aligns with the broader theme of responsible consumption, it may not be directly transferable to all types of ethical considerations.

We analyze 1680 questionnaires collected via the Environment module of the 2020 Taiwan Social Change Survey that is characterized by a self-reported behavior-intention gap (BIG) found in the data set. Considering the heterogeneity of the BIG, the estimated results of partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) show that the extended TPB model provides a good explanation of the consumers' intentions except for the subgroup of respondents with a large BIG. This finding suggests that, when using theories of reasoned action such as the TPB for research, one should consider the heterogeneity of respondents to draw effective policy implications for each group. As for those respondents with a non-discernible or small BIG, increasing consumers' perceived behavioral control, such as reducing the inconvenience of applying SU substitutes, plays an important role in enhancing the consumers' intentions to reduce their usage of SU products. It is noteworthy that SU recyclable or SU biodegradable substitutes may be viewed by some consumers as environmentally friendly and therefore weaken their intentions to reduce the use of SU products. This greenwashing effect is evidenced by the results for the respondents with a medium BIG. The above difference in the greenwashing effect is not discovered if the heterogeneity of the BIG is not taken into consideration. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Behavior-intention gap (BIG); Greenwashing; Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM); Single-use product; Sustainable consumption; Theory of planned behavior (TPB),Consumer behavior; Least squares approximations; Behavior-intention gap; Behaviour intentions; Greenwashing; Partial least square structural equation modeling; Partial least-squares; Single use; Single-use product; Structural equation models; Sustainable consumption; Theory of planned behavior; Public policy,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85145665583,"Yes, possibly","Asymmetries, Sustainability","
While the reference paper doesn't directly focus on information-seeking processes like your study, it touches upon relevant themes that could be valuable to your research:

* **Asymmetries and Greenwashing:** The paper highlights the ""greenwashing effect"" where consumers perceive recyclable or biodegradable single-use products as environmentally friendly, potentially weakening their intentions to reduce consumption. This aligns with your interest in information barriers and how they can influence responsible consumption. You could use this finding to support your argument that accessible and transparent information is crucial to counter misleading marketing tactics and empower consumers to make truly responsible choices.

* **Sustainability and Behavioral Intention:** The paper investigates factors influencing consumers' intentions to reduce single-use product consumption, which is a specific aspect of sustainable consumption. Although their focus is on behavioral intention rather than the information-seeking process itself, their findings on the influence of perceived behavioral control (e.g., reducing inconvenience of substitutes) could be relevant to your discussion on how information systems and decision-support tools can address barriers and foster responsible consumption.

**Further Considerations:**

* **Limited Focus on Information Seeking:** Keep in mind that the reference paper's primary focus is not on information-seeking behaviors. While it offers insights into information asymmetries and their impact on consumption, it doesn't delve deeply into the processes consumers use to seek and evaluate information.
* **Specific Context:** The study focuses on single-use products, which might not be directly transferable to all aspects of responsible consumption explored in your research. However, the underlying principles of information asymmetry and greenwashing can be applied more broadly.

Consequently, when confronted with green advertising appeals, individuals often infer ulterior motives, do not purchase sustainable products and are less inclined to behave pro-environmentally. Based on their success in regular advertising campaigns, social media influencers (SMIs) have been recommended as endorsers for green products to increase advertising effectiveness and sustainable behavior, but no empirical evidence supports these suggestions. An online study with a two-level between-subjects experimental design (N = 145) was employed to validate the positive impact of green advertising on SMIs’ followers compared to non-followers. Results indicate that followers, who have established an intense parasocial relationship with the SMI, believe them to be more trustworthy and consequently attribute affective rather than calculative motives. The attribution of an affective motive, in turn, increased green advertising effectiveness. Furthermore, parasocial relationships enhanced pro-environmental intentions regarding sustainable behavior. © 2022 The Author(s).

While the reference paper doesn't directly focus on information-seeking processes like your study, it touches upon relevant themes:

* **Information Asymmetries:** The paper highlights the issue of greenwashing, which creates an information asymmetry between companies and consumers. Consumers lack access to transparent and reliable information about a product's true environmental impact. This aligns with your interest in information barriers and their influence on responsible consumption.
* **Sustainability:** The paper investigates how social media influencers can potentially bridge this information gap and promote pro-environmental intentions. Although it doesn't delve into information-seeking behaviors, it explores the effectiveness of communication strategies in shaping sustainable consumption.

**How to Utilize:**

1. **Contextualize Greenwashing:** You can cite this paper to provide context on the prevalence of greenwashing and its impact on consumer trust. This strengthens your argument for the importance of accessible and transparent information in driving responsible consumption.
2. **Alternative Communication Strategies:** While your focus is on information systems and decision-support tools, the paper offers insights into the potential of influencer marketing as a communication strategy to address information asymmetries. You could briefly discuss this as a complementary approach.
3. **Limitations:** You can point out that the paper focuses on influencer marketing, which might not be universally applicable or accessible to all consumers. This reinforces the need for broader solutions like improved information systems that cater to diverse needs and contexts.

However, with an increase in greenwashing, skepticism has grown among consumers. Regardless of manufacturers' efforts to enhance consumer awareness via green advertising, consumer skepticism toward these advertisements creates doubt and consequently reduces positive attitudes and intentions to buy green products. This study investigated the variables that impact Vietnamese consumers' decision-making processes toward green beauty care products. Specifically, we focused on the role of AW concerns and skepticism toward green advertising. For this study, we adopted the timulus-response organism (SOR) framework, which is known for its ability to analyze the impact of environmental stimuli (S) on personal perceptions (O), leading to specific responses (R). We elucidated the relationship between concern for AW and green advertising skepticism (GAS) as stimulus factors, green brand trust (GBT) and attitude toward green products (ATT) as organism factors, and three sub-dimensions of behavioral intentions (BI): green purchase intention (GPI), word-of-mouth (WOM), and willingness to pay (WPP) as response factors. We explored the mediating effect of ATT on the relationship between GAS-GPI and AW-GPI. This study involved 386 Vietnamese participants surveyed using convenience sampling. Smart PLS v3.2.9 software was used to analyze the data using structural equation modeling. The hypothesis test using PLS-SEM confirmed that (a) GBT had a positive effect on BI and ATT; (b) ATT had a positive effect on BI; (c) GAS had a negative effect on GBT and WPP, but not on GPI and WOM; and (d) AW had a positive effect on GPI and WOM, but not on ATT and WPP. Surprisingly, this study found insufficient statistical evidence to support the mediating role of ATT in the relationship between GAS-GPI and AW-GPI. This study highlights the importance of integrated advertising and education campaigns in increasing customer awareness toward green products and the significance of comprehending the cultural context when developing marketing strategies, especially in emerging markets such as Vietnam, where environmental concerns are skeptical and AW issues are relatively new. The study delved into the Vietnam market and specifically examined beauty care products labeled as “not tested on animals.” Additionally, we addressed a gap in the existing research by investigating the combined influence of AW concerns and GAS on the formation of green behavioral intentions (GBI). © 2024 The Author(s)",Animal welfare; Behavioral intentions; Green advertisement; Green behavioral intention; Skepticism; Vietnam,Advertising; Animal Welfare; Animals; Attitude; Beauty; Consumer Behavior; Humans; Intention; Vietnam; advertising; animal; animal welfare; attitude; behavior; consumer attitude; esthetics; human; Viet Nam,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85187574729,Possibly,"Asymmetries, Sustainability","
While the reference paper focuses on Vietnamese consumers' perspectives on green beauty care products, it touches upon elements relevant to your research:

However, the technical, ethical, and legal literature on how AI, including its design, training, implementation, and use can be sustainable, is rather limited. At the same time, consumers incrementally pay more attention to sustainability information, whereas businesses are increasingly engaging in greenwashing practices, especially in relation to digital products and services, raising concerns about the efficiency of the existing consumer protection framework in this regard. The objective of this paper is to contribute to the discussion toward sustainable AI from a legal and consumer protection standpoint while focusing on the environmental and societal pillar of sustainability. After analyzing the multidisciplinary literature available on the topic of the environmentally sustainable AI lifecycle, as well as the latest EU policies and initiatives regarding consumer protection and sustainability, we will examine whether the current consumer protection framework is sufficient to promote sharing and substantiation of sustainability information in B2C contracts involving AI products and services. Moreover, we will assess whether AI-related AI initiatives can promote a sustainable AI development. Finally, we will propose a set of recommendations capable of encouraging a sustainable and environmentally-conscious AI lifecycle while enhancing information transparency among stakeholders, aligning the various EU policies and initiatives, and ultimately empowering consumers. © 2021 by the authors.

This study aims to identify factors that allow the detection of “greenwashing” practices in Colombian companies across various industrial sectors holding certifications such as ISO14001, the Colombian environmental seal, the district environmental excellence program, or international/regional environmental certifications. We employed a quantitative, cross-sectional methodology using three machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) and the double machine learning technique to identify causal effects and significant variables. Additionally, a greenwashing indicator was formulated, considering two variables: (a) Presence of a comprehensive solid waste management plan, and (b) Presence of a water usage and conservation program. Our findings reveal substantial variations in the adoption of environmental management practices across diverse industrial sectors and regions in Colombia. It is noteworthy that our research emphasizes that: (i) companies with an environmental contingency plan and a monitoring program are less likely to engage in greenwashing; (ii) expenses for personnel dedicated to environmental protection activities and the investment and expenses related to air and climate protection also reduce the likelihood of greenwashing; (iii) companies in the manufacturing of non-metallic mineral products sector are more likely to engage in greenwashing. It was also found that a significant proportion of Colombian industrial companies with environmental certifications do not fully embrace sustainable practices, implying limited effectiveness of environmental certifications in the country (56,09%). This research contributes to the taxonomy of greenwashing by delving into various types identified in the literature. It sheds light on selective disclosure, emphasizing that mere certification without tangible actions can constitute greenwashing. The broadened concept of decoupling now includes not only meeting shareholder expectations but also failing to meet those set by certifications. Attention deflection involves diverting focus toward certifications rather than real investments in environmental practices. Deceptive manipulation occurs when certifications create a misleading perception without concrete actions. Additionally, dubious authorizations and labels are revealed, showcasing the vulnerability of eco-labels to fraud. The study enriches existing categories, viewing certifications as potential instruments for greenwashing, reinforcing the need for substantial, measurable actions to validate sustainability claims. © 2024 The Author(s)",Decision Tree; Double machine learning; Greenwashing; LASSO; Logistic regression; Machine Learning; Random Forest,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85185509590,Yes,Asymmetries,"

Previous research has shown that online health information seeking is associated with medication adherence. However, the direction of this relationship is still a matter of dispute. Even less is known about the factors that moderate such a relationship. Objective: To investigate the heterogeneous influences of online health information seeking on the use of aspirin in CVD prevention and the possible moderating factors among the applicable adult population in the U.S from 2016 to 2018. Methods: Respondents aged 40 or older, based on guidelines for aspirin use, were sampled from the 2016 to 2018 National Health Interview Survey. Linear probability models were used to test the association between patients’ aspirin use behaviors and the variables of interest in four separate sub-populations. Results: Aspirin use for CVD prevention was associated with online health information seeking in different ways. When patients received doctors’ advice to use aspirin, online information seeking has a negative influence on aspirin use, depending on whether the individual has CVD risk factors. However, for patients without recommendations from providers, the effects of online information seeking on self-initiated aspirin use depend on the different types of prevention (i.e., primary vs. secondary) and CVD risk factors. Conclusions: Online health information might lead to both overuse and underuse of aspirin in CVD prevention. Online information seeking interacts with other information sources affecting consumers' decision making. Key consumer characteristics and risk factors may also moderate such a relationship. © 2024 Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine",Aspirin use; Cardiovascular disease prevention; Health information seeking; Medication adherence,acetylsalicylic acid; adult; aged; Article; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; controlled study; female; human; information seeking; Internet; male; medical information; medication compliance; middle aged; probability; prophylaxis; risk factor; United States,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85183552842,Possibly,Information Seeking,"

The increase of online shopping affords an opportunity to provide consumers with actionable feedback on the social and environmental impact of potential purchases, at the exact moment when it is relevant. Unfortunately, consumers are inundated with ambiguous sustainability information. For example, greenwashing can make it difficult to identify environmentally friendly products. The highest-quality options, such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) scores or tailored impact certificates (e.g., environmentally friendly tags), designed for assessing the environmental impact of consumption, are ineffective in the setting of online shopping. They are simply too costly to provide a feasible solution when scaled up, and often rely on data from self-interested market players.

The reference paper focuses on identifying sponsored content in YouTube videos using information extraction techniques. This could be relevant to your research in the following way:

* **Understanding Information Barriers:** Your paper highlights the importance of accessible and transparent information for responsible consumption. The techniques used in the reference paper to identify sponsored content could be adapted to analyze how information about a product's ethical or sustainable aspects is presented (or hidden) in online environments. This could help you identify potential information barriers that consumers face when trying to make responsible choices.

* **Analyzing Greenwashing:** The reference paper's focus on identifying sponsored content could be relevant to your interest in information asymmetries.  You could explore whether companies use sponsored content or misleading language to downplay negative environmental or social impacts, effectively engaging in greenwashing.

**Important Note:**  The relevance hinges on your ability to adapt the information extraction techniques from the reference paper to the specific context of sustainability and responsible consumption. You would need to identify relevant keywords, knowledge sources, and named entities related to ethical and sustainable practices."

This paper is relevant to your research in two key ways:

* **Information Availability:** The reference paper directly addresses the impact of information availability (or lack thereof) on consumer behavior, particularly in the context of ""green"" consumption. Their findings on information avoidance and the influence of perceived information reliability align with your interest in how information barriers shape the prioritization of ethical aspects during decision-making. You could cite this paper to support your argument that accessible and transparent information is crucial for driving responsible consumption.

* **Asymmetries:** The paper highlights the issue of information asymmetries, specifically through the lens of ""greenwashing."" This concept directly relates to your focus on ethical consumption. You can use their findings on self-serving information avoidance and the potential for ""fake news"" to strengthen your argument about the need for improved information systems and decision-support tools to combat misleading information and empower consumers to make informed choices.


**Additional Points:**

* While the reference paper focuses on ""green"" consumption, its findings are likely generalizable to other forms of socially and ethically responsible consumption.
* You might consider contrasting your study's focus on ""search behaviors"" with the reference paper's emphasis on ""information avoidance."" This could lead to a richer discussion about the complexities of information-seeking processes in the context of responsible consumption."

To do so, they are applying green marketing strategies to help gain competitive advantage and appeal to ecologically conscious consumers. However, not all green marketing claims accurately reflect firms’ environmental conduct, and can be viewed as ‘greenwashing’. Greenwashing may not only affect a company’s profitability, but more importantly, result in ethical harm. Therefore, this research extends past greenwashing studies by examining additional influences on and outcomes of perceived greenwashing. To do so, we conducted two studies, an interview study with consumer product and consulting firms, as well as an experiment examining consumers interacting with a company website. For these studies, we used multiple methods, including interviews, questionnaires, and neurophysiological techniques. We found that perceived greenwashing relates not only to environmental and product perceptions, but also to consumers’ happiness while interacting with the website. We also found that website interactivity relates to perceived greenwashing, environmental and product perceptions, and to the amount of interaction with the website. We conclude by discussing managerial and ethical implications for research and practice. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Brand attitudes; Environmental sustainability; Facial expressions; Green risk; Green value; Interactivity; Mouse interactions; Purchase intentions; Website design,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85080942589,Yes,Asymmetries,"
The reference paper, ""Perceived Greenwashing: The Effects of Green Marketing on Environmental and Product Perceptions,"" is relevant to your research because it directly addresses the concept of **information asymmetries** in the context of sustainable consumption.  

Here's how you can utilize it:

* **Supporting your argument:** The paper provides empirical evidence of how companies can mislead consumers through greenwashing, creating an information asymmetry where consumers lack the full and accurate information needed to make responsible choices. This supports your argument about the importance of accessible and transparent information for fostering responsible consumption.
* **Expanding on information barriers:** While your paper focuses on general information barriers, the reference paper delves into a specific type of barrier – deceptive marketing practices. You can cite this paper to illustrate how greenwashing acts as a barrier to accessing reliable information about a product's ethical and environmental impact.
* **Highlighting the ethical dimension:** The reference paper emphasizes the ethical implications of greenwashing, aligning with your paper's focus on socially and ethically responsible consumption. You can draw upon their discussion of ethical harm to strengthen your argument for the need to address information asymmetries.

The role of the consumer as the arbiter of the market is fundamental. The abuse of consumer confidence depends, in fact, on the spread of stereotyped messages and vague and generic formulas aimed at hiding a dangerous vacuum of protection. In both markets, it is a question of giving the consumer the necessary tools to monitor the transparency of the criteria used by the trader to classify a product according to its characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the analysis of an Italian case law and the European programme, the author shows how in Italy there is a dangerous lack of consumer protection. The problem is that the green consumer, as well as the online consumer, is not able to immediately verify the accuracy of the product requirements and must be able to count on the seriousness of the professional. For this reason, the European and national authorities have provided specific rules for both markets. The new proposal of directive introduces specific rules to target unfair commercial practices that mislead consumers away from sustainable consumption choices and introduced many innovations, such as the ban on greenwashing. Findings: This work aims to identify the tools necessary to make the information on the products offered in the digital market and those related to green products more reliable but above all to create a common methodology on which to base them. High is the risk that sustainability will become a simple marketing strategy for companies. The difficulty consists in the absence of certain and verifiable parameters by the consumer to really measure the characteristics and the quality of a product characteristic of a product compared to competing ones. Originality/value: This work examines the problem of consumer protection in the digital and green market from a new perspective, comparing the information asymmetries with respect to the professionals in the two markets. Starting from the cases of greenwashing and analysing new European remedies, the author suggests for both markets, specific answers different from those required for advertising in general. The problem here is not only the truth of the message but also the vagueness and genericity. The consumer must be in a position to control the criteria used by the professional to classify products, both in the green and the digital market.

This paper is relevant to your research in two key ways:

1. **Information Asymmetries:** The reference paper directly addresses the issue of information asymmetries between consumers and businesses, particularly in the context of greenwashing. This aligns with your focus on information barriers and how they influence responsible consumption. You can cite this paper to support your argument that consumers often lack access to transparent and reliable information about the ethical aspects of products, leading to challenges in making informed decisions.

2. **Information Availability and Responsible Consumption:** The paper highlights how the lack of clear and verifiable information about product sustainability can hinder consumers' ability to prioritize responsible choices. This directly connects to your research on how information availability shapes the valuation of ethical aspects during decision-making. You can use this paper to illustrate the real-world consequences of information gaps and the need for improved information systems, as you advocate in your own work.


**Additional Notes:**

* While the paper focuses on greenwashing, the underlying concepts of information asymmetry and its impact on consumer behavior are broadly applicable to other areas of responsible consumption.
* The paper's discussion of European regulations and directives related to greenwashing could provide valuable context for your own discussion on the need for improved information systems and decision-support tools."

The reason for this is the fact that the issue of reconciling pro-environmental beliefs of consumers with their real behavior is still topical. Businesses need to be careful with their green claims and focus on authentic green marketing in order to attract and retain the trust of environmentally conscious consumers in the long term. The research employs quantitative data analysis, drawing data from the survey, which was run online for five weeks and collected 4700 responses. The respondents are people who live in Czechia and have shopped in one of five stores at least during the last month. The reason for focusing on the Czechia is primarily the fact that green marketing is basically only on the rise here, while greenwashing still remains a significant problem. Six hypothesis were formulated, and linear regression analysis was used to test them. Key findings of the research revealed that green products and promotions positively influence brand associations and perceived brand quality, while green promotions significantly enhance brand loyalty and trust. Additionally, there was observed influence of consumers´environmental concerns and consideration of future consequences significantly moderating the relationship between green marketing and brand equity.

However, this critical review article draws attention to potential negative impacts associated with certifications. The purpose of this review is to highlight the risks and challenges associated with certifications despite their intended benefits. Methods: The review draws on existing literature on certifications and their impacts, as well as empirical studies on the effectiveness of certifications in addressing climate change, safeguarding human rights, and promoting environmentally sustainable practices. Results: The review finds that certifications can increase the perceived value of eco-friendly brands and consumer willingness to pay. However, the review also highlights the risks of greenwashing and free riding, which can undermine the intended benefits of certifications. Additionally, the institutional organization of certification systems may exhibit structural inertia, which may impede the integration of disruptive green technologies and market transitions. Discussion: The potential negative impacts of certifications on addressing climate change, safeguarding human rights, and promoting environmentally sustainable practices should not be overlooked. It is essential to implement measures to mitigate the risks of eco-opportunism and to effectively combat greenwashing. The review suggests that certification systems should be designed to promote innovation and the adoption of new technologies, rather than being a barrier to change. Conclusion: Certifications are important tools for addressing climate change, safeguarding human rights, and promoting environmentally sustainable practices.

We set out to explore the mechanisms explaining the relationships between environmental attitudes, perceived environmental knowledge, and green consumption values on consumer behaviors, specifically the mediating roles of receptivity to green communication and social media engagement with environmentally friendly firms. We also investigated the moderating role of information seeking in these relationships. Data were collected through a survey of 610 Greek respondents between May and July 2024 and analyzed using IBM SPSS and AMOS version 23. Findings show significant and positive paths between green consumption values and receptivity to green communication, e-word-of-mouth intention, food behavior, and other environmental behaviors, while receptivity to green communication and social media consumers’ engagement with environmentally friendly firms has a significant and positive impact on e-word-of-mouth intention and food behavior.

This paper is relevant to your research in a couple of key ways:

* **Information Seeking:** The reference paper directly investigates the role of information seeking in shaping sustainable consumption behaviors.  Their findings on how ""credible and detailed communication is essential for engaging information-seeking consumers"" aligns with your focus on information barriers and the need for accessible, transparent information. You could cite this paper to support your argument that improved information systems are crucial for fostering responsible consumption.

* **Sustainability:** While the paper focuses on food consumption, its broader themes of green communication, social media engagement, and the influence of environmental attitudes on behavior are relevant to your study on socially and ethically responsible consumption in general. You could draw parallels between their findings on the impact of green communication and your own exploration of how information influences the valuation of ethical aspects during decision-making.

**Specific Points to Consider:**

* **Contrast in Scope:** While both papers deal with responsible consumption, your work has a broader scope than the reference paper's focus on food. Be mindful of this difference when drawing comparisons or using their findings as direct support for your arguments.
* **Methodological Differences:** The reference paper uses a quantitative survey approach, while your study's methodology isn't specified. Consider how these differences might influence the generalizability or applicability of their findings to your own research context.

The empirical findings provide a taxonomy of decisive attribute levels and their part-worth utilities which affect consumers’ decisions. From this, media management recommendations can be derived. Some findings may be worrying for media management. For example, search engines will increase the competitive pressure on journalistic media the better they provide personalised search results. However, the results also indicate that users’ search behaviours open up a large field for media companies’ brand-driven distribution strategies. This is possible because almost half of search engines’ search queries are by brand name or media label. The weakness of media companies is revealed above all in the field of advertising. Nonetheless, media companies are still highly competitive due to their journalistic potential.

This paper reviews the methodologies and criteria of sustainability applied to fashion products, regarding products’ environmental footprint (environmental life cycle assessment/analysis; e-LCA), the social issues (including the social life cycle assessment/analysis; s-LCA) and the transparency in reporting sustainability. In our review we seek KPIs (key performance indicators) that allow classification of a pair of shoes or a piece of cloth on a scale from A to E, i.e., products can be compared with a benchmark and classified accordingly with a simple labelling scheme, which is easily understandable by the consumers. This approach is similar to those used to classify electrical appliances, housing energy consumption for thermal comfort, food Nutri-Scores, CO2 levels of road vehicles, and tire performance. In this review we aim to identify the initiatives and measures being put into practice by the top global fashion brands. We found that, despite the existence of GRI (global sustainability reporting initiative) standard reporting, most companies follow their own methods or others created within the industry rather than those created in the scientific community. Examples include the Higg index, the Transparency Index, and the Social Codes of Conduct (CoC). In this study, we conducted an extensive review of certification schemes and labels already applied to fashion prod-ucts, and identified a multitude of labels and lack of harmonization in communicating sustainability. As result, we compiled a summary table of all criteria, methodologies, and possible KPIs that can be considered the basis for a benchmark and score of a fashion product. This topic is crucial to avoid “green washing” and a lack of transparency for the buyer’s community, i.e., business to consumer (B2C), and for the business community, i.e., business to business (B2B) relationships, which comprise a complex multi-layer supply chain of suppliers and sub-suppliers. The UNSDG 2030 “Responsible Consumption and Production” frames these efforts to facilitate standardization of KPIs in terms of structure, criteria, and their measurement. The most common KPI is environmental global warming impact (expressed as CO2eq) based on life cycle assessment/analysis (LCA) principles (established in 2000), which provide an appropriate base to monitor and benchmark products. However, in our innovative review of t-shirt e-LCA, we identified a wide range of e-LCA assumptions, relating to different boundaries, allocations, functional units, and impact categories, which represent a major challenge in benchmarking. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper could be useful to your research in a few ways:

* **Information Availability:** The paper directly addresses the issue of information availability regarding sustainability in the fashion industry. It highlights the lack of standardization and the multitude of labels and certifications, which can create confusion and act as a barrier for consumers seeking information about responsible consumption. This aligns with your focus on information barriers and their influence on consumer behavior. You could cite this paper to support your argument about the challenges consumers face in accessing clear and reliable information about the ethical aspects of products.

* **Information Asymmetries:** The paper discusses ""greenwashing"" practices, which exemplify information asymmetries between companies and consumers. Companies may exaggerate or misrepresent their sustainability efforts, making it difficult for consumers to make informed decisions. This point connects with your interest in the role of transparency and how it shapes consumer valuation of ethical aspects.

* **Sustainability:** While the paper primarily focuses on the fashion industry, its discussion of sustainability methodologies, KPIs, and the need for standardization can provide valuable context for your broader research on responsible consumption. You could draw upon its insights to illustrate the complexities involved in measuring and communicating sustainability, which ultimately influences consumer choices.



**Important Note:**

While the reference paper offers relevant insights, it's important to critically evaluate its scope and focus. It primarily deals with the fashion industry, so its direct applicability to other consumption domains might be limited.

The sample comprises 92 matched pairs of funds. Our research shows that self-labeled sustainable funds exhibit better ESG performance and sustainability risk scores than their pairs, indicating alignment with their identity and nature. Furthermore, the results also indicate that there are different ESG behaviors depending on the geographical areas of investment. In particular, funds with portfolios invested in Europe present a higher ESG performance than those invested in North America, and funds invested in Emerging Markets and Asia present a lower performance and higher risk than those in North America. This paper provides three main novelties: 1) multiregional perspective, 2) different ESG score perspectives using different and complementary indicators of sustainable behavior based on risk and performance, and 3) a matching process starting with the same fund management company, geographical area of investment and investment category that help us isolate the issue of the use of ESG labels.

With the rise of the green economy and the awakening of consumers’ awareness of sustainable consumption, more and more companies realize the significance of green marketing in improving brand performance. However, it is undeniable that many fast fashion companies tend to take advantage of information asymmetry and cover up the unsustainable part of their business activities through fake green marketing campaigns to gain more potential consumers. There is a limited number of green marketing studies investigating consumers’ perception of greenwashing, while it is naturally important to explore the demand side responses to greenwashing in different industries. Therefore, this paper examines whether and how consumers’ perception of greenwashing in the fast fashion industry impacts their green purchase intention. The study explores the mediating role of perceived risk and the moderating role of consumers’ impulsive buying. In this paper, 433 valid questionnaires are collected from mainland China, and the Partial Least Square-Structural Equation (PLS-SEM) is used to test the hypotheses. We draw the following conclusions: (1) consumers’ perception of greenwashing in the fast fashion industry has a direct negative effect on their green purchase intention; (2) greenwashing perception has an indirect negative effect through consumers’ risk perception, including financial perceived risk and green perceived risk; (3) consumers’ impulsive buying in the fast fashion industry reinforces the positive effect of greenwashing on their financial risk perceptions as a moderating variable.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on 174 responses gathered through a street survey method from 5 different universities in Turkey, data are analyzed using the statistical package for social sciences software (SPSS 16.0). Principal component analysis is performed to assess the differentiation in factors. Multiple regression analysis is used to examine the effects of the items on the post-millennials purchasing and recommendation behavior. Findings: The main findings revealed that the environmental concern trait of post-millennials triggers their green purchasing behavior. When the concern on green products is high, the awareness of perceiving that “if the product is actually green or pretending to be green” is high. When the post-millennials take the greenwashing perception into account, their environmental concern has lower effects on their green behavior. The moderating role of greenwashing between environmental concern and green purchasing is apparent. Greenwashing perception decreases the effects of environmental concern on green behavior. Originality/value: The research raises the concept of greenwashing perception that moderates the relationship between environmental concern and post-millennials purchasing behavior. This study also demonstrates that greenwashing awareness has a critical role in creating a purchasing behavior of post-millennials that have environmental concerns. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Conscious purchasing behavior; Environmental concern; Greenwashing; Post-millennials,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85106718865,Yes,Asymmetries,"
This paper is relevant because it directly addresses the concept of **information asymmetries** in the context of sustainable consumption.  

* **Greenwashing as an Information Asymmetry:** The reference paper highlights how greenwashing practices create an information asymmetry between companies and consumers. Companies may present their products as more environmentally friendly than they actually are, misleading consumers who lack complete information.

* **Connecting to Your Research:** You can use this paper to support your argument about the importance of **information availability and transparency** in shaping responsible consumption. The reference paper demonstrates how a lack of accurate information (due to greenwashing) can hinder consumers' ability to make ethical choices, even if they have initial intentions to consume responsibly.

* **Expanding Your Discussion:** You could discuss the reference paper's findings in the context of your own research on information barriers.  It provides a concrete example of how information asymmetries can act as a barrier to responsible consumption. You could also explore how your proposed solutions (improved information systems, decision-support tools) could help mitigate the negative effects of greenwashing and empower consumers to make more informed decisions.

Online searching for mental health information is increasingly common, especially by adolescents and parents. We examined historical trends and factors that may influence population-level patterns in information seeking for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We extracted Google Trends data from January 2004 to February 2020. Keywords included “ADHD,” “ADHD treatment,” “ADHD medication,” and “ADHD therapy.” We examined trends (systematic change over time) and seasonality (repeating pattern of change) via time-series analyses and graphics. We also used interrupted time-series analyses to examine the impact of celebrity and pharmaceutical events. Queries of “ADHD medication” increase, while queries for “ADHD therapy” remain relatively low despite a positive linear trend. Searches for “ADHD treatment” displayed a downward trend in more recent years. Analyses on seasonality revealed that holiday breaks coincided with a decrease in search interest, while post-break periods illustrated a rise, and the ADHD Awareness Month (October) coincided with a rise of public interest in all four search terms. Celebrity effects were more prominent in earlier years; the “Own It” pharmaceutical campaign may have increased ADHD awareness and the specificity of searches for “ADHD medication.” The anonymous, accessible, and low-cost nature of seeking information online makes search engines like Google important sources of mental health information. Changing search patterns in response to seasonal, advocacy, and media events highlight internet-based opportunities for raising awareness and disseminating empirically supported information. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",ADHD; Google Trends; Information seeking; Time series,Adolescent; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Humans; Information Seeking Behavior; Internet; Mental Health; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Search Engine; drug; adolescent; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; human; information seeking; Internet; mental health; search engine,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85115312428,Possibly,Information seeking,"
While the reference paper focuses on mental health information seeking, it offers valuable insights into the broader topic of online information seeking behaviors. You could utilize this paper in the following ways:

* **Comparative Analysis:**  Compare and contrast the information-seeking patterns observed for mental health with those related to sustainable or responsible consumption. This could highlight similarities and differences in how people search for information on complex and often emotionally charged topics.
* **Methodological Inspiration:** The reference paper employs a Google Trends analysis to track search patterns over time. You could consider using a similar approach to investigate trends in searches related to sustainable products, ethical brands, or responsible consumption practices.
* **Framing Information Barriers:** The paper discusses the accessibility and anonymity of online information as factors influencing search behavior. You could draw parallels to the information barriers consumers face when trying to make responsible consumption choices, such as lack of transparency, confusing labeling, or greenwashing tactics.

**Important Note:**

While the reference paper provides relevant insights into information-seeking behaviors, it's crucial to emphasize the differences in context between mental health and responsible consumption.  Be cautious about directly applying findings from one domain to the other without careful consideration and contextualization."

However, as organizations acknowledge seniors as an increasingly attractive digital market segment due to their economic power, free time and their high longevity, there remains a paucity of studies that focus on the online shopping behavior of the elderly consumers. Using a qualitative methodology, which involved 5 focus groups and 45 Portuguese and Spanish elderly, the present research has the main objectives to understand how seniors behave throughout the online purchase decision making process and to examine the role and relevance that the elderly attribute to the brands in social media. The results suggest a widespread resistance of the Iberian Peninsula seniors to make online purchases, although some of the Portuguese seniors do it in low-involvement purchases and more regularly than the Spanish ones. Seniors' digital involvement with brand webpages serves to support their purchase decision-making process, from information search about characteristics, features or products' prices of the product they intend to purchase, but also for the evaluation of alternatives, based on the opinions of other internet users until the purchase decision and post-purchase. Their information search frequency in the Facebook pages of the brands is variable and their perception about these pages is negative, due to the presence of advertising, to brand pressure but also to their contents (photographs and products descriptions) presented on those pages. © 8th European Conference on Social Media, ECSM 2021.",elderly; Iberian Peninsula; ICT; online consumer behavior; social media,Decision making; Information retrieval; Sales; Social networking (online); Consumer decision process; Decision-making process; Elderly; Facebook; Iberian Peninsula; ICT; Information search; Online consumer behavior; Purchase decision; Social media; Consumer behavior,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85143750242,Possibly,Information seeking,"

The current interpretation of the economic approach, most notably the European Commission guidelines issued in 2004 on the application of Article 101(3) of the TFEU, has led to situations where agreements between undertakings to stop the sale of unsustainable products or production processes have been discouraged, thereby, potentially reducing sustainable consumption. These agreements have the potential to increase sustainable consumption as well as reduce greenwashing by stopping the sale of products that do not meet certain sustainability criteria. In this chapter, it is examined how the current European Commission guidelines could be improved to allow undertakings to assess their agreements in a way that is quantifiable but that goes beyond a neoclassical economic approach focusing solely on monetary well-being. Such an approach may reduce the inhibitive effect of EU competition law on sustainable consumption by allowing agreements that promote human well-being.

They are intended to enable consumers to compare the environmental impacts of multiple products and make more sustainable consumption choices. Falling outside of the three types defined in the ISO 14020 environmental label and declarations series, the recent proliferation of these business-to-consumer communication instruments has resulted in the creation of a plethora of methodologies to derive product performance ratings. Interest from consumers wanting more information on the products they purchase, as well as the promise of policy instruments aiming to increase transparency and combat greenwashing, are fuelling further multiplication of schemes. A move towards more credible, evidence-based environmental rating ecolabels is therefore urgently needed to promote assessment based on scientific understanding, gain consumer trust, and realise policy objectives. We propose a framework based on four core principles - i) relevance, ii) scientific robustness, iii) trust and transparency, and iv) feasibility (scalability, affordability) - with 18 guidelines that can be followed by rating scheme developers. We characterise the rise of environmental rating ecolabels in geographical Europe and build an inventory of 33 existing schemes, at various stages of development and implementation, to which we apply the framework. This reveals the potential for significant improvement in current schemes, indicating important areas for development. The framework provides a valuable guide for the development of new schemes or an evaluation grid for existing initiatives. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Ecolabels; Environmental labelling; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Product environmental footprint; Sustainable consumption and production,Commerce; Communication; Consumer Behavior; Environment; Europe; cell proliferation; consumer; environmental footprint; environmental impact; Europe; feasibility study; greenwashing; human; life cycle assessment; note; practice guideline; trust; commercial phenomena; consumer attitude; environment; interpersonal communication,Note,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85149903261,Yes,"Availability, Asymmetries","

However, the prevalence of fake reviews, driven by commercial interests, undermines the reliability of these evaluations. Therefore, detecting and managing fake reviews is essential for ensuring the proper functioning of websites and maintaining a clean online environment. This research study proposes a novel approach for detecting fake reviews by leveraging a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) that integrates semantic similarity. The method incorporates word-level and document-level information to construct a graph neural network for text classification. Edges between words are established based on the Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) index and semantic similarity measured through word embeddings. Additionally, edges between words and comments are created using TF-IDF feature values. The transfer feature of the graph neural network is then utilized to aggregate and extract crucial features from the constructed graph, enabling the classification of fake reviews. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared to traditional approaches such as CNN, LSTM, and Text-GCN, the proposed method achieves substantial improvements in accuracy, with respective increases of 7%, 4.8%, and 1.3%.

The reference paper focuses on using deep learning to detect fake reviews on service-oriented websites. This is a technical problem related to data integrity and online trust, but it doesn't address the core themes of your research:

* **Information Seeking:** Your paper examines how consumers actively search for and process information related to ethical consumption. The reference paper doesn't explore consumer information-seeking behaviors.
* **Information Availability and Barriers:** Your paper is interested in how the accessibility and transparency of information influence responsible choices. The reference paper deals with identifying false information, not the availability or barriers to accessing genuine information about ethical consumption.
* **Asymmetries:** Your paper might touch on information asymmetries between companies and consumers regarding ethical practices. However, the reference paper focuses on a different type of asymmetry – the potential for fake reviews to mislead consumers.
* **Sustainability:** Although both papers indirectly relate to responsible consumption, the reference paper's primary focus is on combating deceptive online practices, not promoting sustainable choices.

Such a notion can stimulate new imaginative thinking on a future sustainable world not dominated by neoliberalism. It can also strengthen SDG-12: responsible consumption and production. To do so, it examines the influence of pro-environmental self-identity, market-based barriers, and knowledge barriers on sustainable consumption buying, product lifetime extension, and environmental activism. Survey data was collected via online panels in Sweden (n=504) and the USA (n=1,017). Richly varied and complex findings emerge supporting the merit of this utopian idea. In particular, the importance of pro-environmental self-identity. This study illustrates how the post-capitalism notions of radical incrementalism and people power can initiate change using the civic, political, and environmental activism in sustainable consumption behaviours.

In the context of an ever-evolving global marketplace characterized by a huge number of choices, rapid technological advancements and increased consumer awareness, access to comprehensive product information has emerged as a fundamental factor affecting consumers' preferences, choices, and satisfaction levels. There is a significant scientific gap on Italian wine consumers' readiness to adopt emerging technologies. Therefore, the research objective is to investigate whether Italian wine consumers trust and are willing to use emerging technologies such as Quick Response (QR) code and Blockchain Technology (BCT) and to identify the factors influencing their acceptance. By examining and evaluating several crucial aspects in the context of wine purchases in Italy using an online survey, this work seeks to fill the gap in the literature. These crucial elements include customers' propensity for novelty, information-seeking behaviors, faith in new technology, and the intention to use them during wine purchasing. What can be derived is the positive interconnection between consumers novelty-seeking, information-seeking, intention to use the QR code and trust in emerging technologies. With other words, consumers' information-seeking and novelty-seeking is interconnected and they positively determine consumers trust in technologies and their adoption. The implications of this study are twofold. Firstly, it enriches consumer behavior theory by providing new insights into how information availability and emerging technologies influence consumers’ decision-making processes, particularly in the context of the Italian wine market. Secondly, businesses can leverage these insights to enhance consumer trust and satisfaction, enabling them to make more effective marketing strategies, improve product transparency, and gain a competitive edge in the increasingly competitive wine market. © 2024 The Authors",Blockchain; Consumers' behavior; Information; Novelty; QR code; Wine,Italy; competitiveness; consumption behavior; decision making; statistical analysis; wine,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85207346253,Possibly,Information seeking,"

* **Information-Seeking Behaviors:** The paper investigates Italian wine consumers' ""information-seeking behaviors"" and how these relate to their willingness to adopt new technologies like QR codes for accessing product information. This aligns with your interest in understanding how information-seeking processes influence responsible consumption.
* **Trust and Transparency:** The study explores the connection between consumers' trust in new technologies and their information-seeking behaviors. This could be relevant to your research as it highlights the importance of trust and transparency in information access, which are crucial for fostering responsible consumption.

**How to Utilize:**

1. **Comparative Analysis:** You could compare and contrast the findings of this paper with your own research on information-seeking behaviors related to responsible consumption in a broader context.

2. **Technology as a Tool:** The paper's focus on QR codes could inspire you to consider how specific technologies or information delivery methods might be leveraged to improve access to information about ethical aspects of products, thereby encouraging responsible consumption.

3. **Trust as a Mediator:**  Explore whether the relationship between information-seeking and responsible consumption, as you investigate, is mediated by consumer trust in the information sources.

While the reference paper focuses on a specific app (OLIO) for sustainable consumption, it offers insights into how information availability and barriers influence user engagement.  

Here's how you could potentially utilize it:

* **Information Barriers:** The paper identifies specific barriers related to information, such as ""uncertainty about what OLIO owners do with users’ personal information"" and ""a lack of clarity on how the app works."" These examples could be used to support your argument about the importance of transparent and accessible information in driving responsible consumption.
* **Impact of Information Availability:** The paper highlights how the perceived availability of information (e.g., ""ratings is a source of information about Olio users’ behaviour"") influences user trust and confidence. This aligns with your focus on how information availability shapes the valuation of ethical aspects during decision-making.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Specificity:** The reference paper is highly specific to the OLIO app. While the insights are valuable, you'll need to carefully consider how they generalize to broader contexts of sustainable consumption.
* **Focus:** The paper primarily focuses on user engagement rather than the broader decision-making process you're examining.  

**Recommendation:**

The reference paper could be a useful source for supporting your arguments about information barriers and the impact of information availability. However, be mindful of its specific focus and ensure you draw connections to your broader research context."

This shift towards sustainability, often referred to as the Green Revolution, emphasizes the importance of green practices in fostering environmental, social, and economic value. However, amidst the push for sustainability, greenwashing appeared. Greenwashing, the deceptive practice of capitalizing on environmental actions without meaningful commitment to sustainability, undermines genuine efforts towards sustainability and erodes consumer trust. Greenwashing is present in various sectors of the economy, with a rise in interest in researches focused on the agricultural sector, where the pursuit of sustainability is essential. In this context, the role of agripreneurs (agricultural entrepreneurs) becomes increasingly significant. Agripreneurs are instrumental in driving agricultural innovation and sustainability, yet the risks of greenwashing in this sector remain largely unexplored. This research aims to fill this gap by developing a theoretical framework tailored to the intersection of greenwashing practices and agripreneurship. To achieve that two systematic literature reviews (SLRs) were performed, one focused on agriculture, the other on entrepreneurship as a whole (seeing as there is virtually no studies focused solely on greenwashing in agripreneurship). Our framework encompasses internal factors, such as change management, environmental commitment, and the cultivation of a green brand, as well as external factors, including stakeholder engagement and policy support. By addressing these factors, agripreneurs can navigate the complexities of sustainability and green branding, ensuring their ventures remain authentic and ethical. Furthermore, we propose a research agenda to explore avenues for validating and enhancing our framework, including case studies to validate our framework, blockchain certifications, and the development of indicators for green practices in agripreneurship. In conclusion, this research contributes with practical and theoretical insights into the intersection of greenwashing practices and agripreneurship. By providing a framework for supporting green agripreneurship while avoiding greenwashing, we can begin to offer guidance for agripreneurs seeking to navigate the challenges of sustainability in the agricultural sector.

While the reference paper focuses on greenwashing in agripreneurship, it directly addresses the concept of **information asymmetries** between producers and consumers. Greenwashing practices create a situation where consumers lack access to accurate and transparent information about a product's sustainability claims. This aligns with your interest in information barriers and how they influence responsible consumption.

Here's how you can utilize this paper:

* **Supporting Argument:** You can cite this paper to strengthen your argument about the existence and impact of information asymmetries in the context of responsible consumption.
* **Expanding Scope:** The paper's focus on agripreneurship can broaden the scope of your discussion. You could explore how information asymmetries related to greenwashing might manifest in different sectors, including food production.
* **Theoretical Framework:** While not directly focused on information-seeking processes, the paper's theoretical framework for supporting green agripreneurship could offer valuable insights. You might adapt or draw inspiration from their framework to develop a more nuanced understanding of how information access and transparency can drive responsible consumption.

Findings: The results show that Attitude toward green products partially mediates the relationship between ‘greenwashing perception’ and ‘green purchase intention.’ The results indicate that misleading and false claims by marketers adversely affect customers’ attitudes toward green products, thus developing greenwashing perception of consumers. Practical implications: This study holds significant implications for marketers, highlighting the impact of Attitude toward green products on organizations’ growth. Policymakers have the potential to make a meaningful impact by enacting regulatory reforms aimed at curtailing greenwashed practices. Furthermore, customers can enhance their awareness of unethical marketing tactics and make well-informed choices when navigating the marketplace. Originality/value: This research studies the gap, identifying the role of Consumer attitude as a mediator between greenwashing perception and consumers’ green purchase intention. Thus, it identifies the role of consumers’ green attitudes in sustainable consumption. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",Attitude towards green products; Green marketing; Green purchase intention; Greenwashing; Sustainability; Sustainable development,,Article,Article in press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85206689903,Yes,Asymmetries,"

One link to achieving this transition is to increase the currently low level of sustainable consumption, and sustainability labeling has been shown to directly influence sustainable purchasing decisions. E-commerce retailers have recently picked up on a means to inform online shoppers about sustainable alternatives by introducing on their websites third-party and private sustainability labels as nudging instruments. However, despite its increasing relevance in practice, research lacks evidence about the availability and credibility of sustainability labeling in online retail. Our study is guided by the question of how online retailers use sustainability labels to communicate information on the sustainability of products to consumers. Our empirical research is based on a large-scale dataset containing sustainability information of nearly 17,000 fashion products of the leading online retailers in Germany Zalando and Otto. The results show that a large number of fashion products are tagged as sustainable, with two-thirds carrying a private label and one-third a third-party verified label. Only 14% of the tagged products, however, present credible third-party verified sustainability labels. This low percentage makes it challenging for consumers to comprehend to what degree a product is sustainable. The wide distribution of private labels indicates that most of the available sustainability information in the selected online shops addresses only single sustainability issues, preventing comparability. Furthermore, label heterogeneity can add to the confusion and uncertainty among consumers. Our practical recommendations support political initiatives that tackle the risk of greenwashing resulting from uncertified and weak sustainability information.

This paper is relevant to your research in two key ways:

1. **Information Availability:** The reference paper directly addresses the availability of information regarding sustainable consumption. It highlights that while many products are labeled as ""sustainable,"" a significant portion lack credible third-party verification. This finding supports your argument that information barriers exist and can hinder consumers from prioritizing responsible aspects during decision-making. You can cite this paper as evidence of the limited availability of reliable information on sustainable products, strengthening your point about the need for improved information systems.

2. **Information Asymmetries:** The paper discusses the prevalence of private labels and the lack of standardization, which can create confusion and uncertainty for consumers. This points to an information asymmetry between retailers (who may use vague or misleading labels) and consumers (who struggle to assess the true sustainability of products). This aligns with your focus on information barriers and the challenges consumers face in valuing ethical aspects. You can use this paper to illustrate the existence of such asymmetries and the potential for greenwashing in the context of sustainable consumption.



By incorporating this reference, you can bolster your arguments about the importance of accessible and transparent information in driving responsible consumption."

Design A rapid review of academic and grey literature sources from 29 April to 31 December 2020, covering non-urgent, non-COVID-19 healthcare. Sources were thematically synthesised against an adapted version of the UK Government's Pandemic Flu Ethical Framework to identify underpinning ethical principles. The strength of normative engagement and the quality of the sources were also assessed. Setting NHS maternity and paediatric surgery services in England. Results Searches conducted 8 September-12 October 2020, and updated in March 2021, identified 48 sources meeting the inclusion criteria. Themes that arose include: staff safety; collaborative working - including mutual dependencies across the healthcare system; reciprocity; and inclusivity in service recovery, for example, by addressing inequalities in service access. Embedded in the theme of staff and patient safety is embracing new ways of working, such as the rapid roll out of telemedicine. On assessment, many sources did not explicitly consider how ethical principles might be applied or balanced against one another. Weaknesses in the policy sources included a lack of public and user involvement and the absence of monitoring and evaluation criteria. Conclusions Our findings suggest that relationality is a prominent ethical principle informing resetting NHS non-COVID-19 paediatric surgery and maternity services. Sources explicitly highlight the ethical importance of seeking to minimise disruption to caring and dependent relationships, while simultaneously attending to public safety. Engagement with ethical principles was ethics-lite, with sources mentioning principles in passing rather than explicitly applying them. This leaves decision makers and healthcare professionals without an operationalisable ethical framework to apply to difficult reset decisions and risks inconsistencies in decision making. We recommend further research to confirm or refine the usefulness of the reset phase ethical framework developed through our analysis.  © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

While the reference paper focuses on ethical values in resetting healthcare services after COVID-19, it touches upon themes relevant to your research in a tangential way.  

Here's how it *might* be utilized:

* **Information Barriers and Decision-Making:** The paper highlights that many sources discussing the NHS reset did not explicitly address how ethical principles should be applied or balanced. This echoes your interest in information barriers and how they influence decision-making related to responsible consumption. You could draw a parallel, arguing that just as ethical considerations are often glossed over in complex healthcare decisions, consumers may also face information barriers that prevent them from fully considering the ethical implications of their purchasing choices.
* **""Ethics-Lite"" Approach:** The paper criticizes the ""ethics-lite"" approach found in many NHS reset documents. This concept could be relevant to your work if you find evidence of similar superficial engagement with ethical considerations in marketing or product information related to sustainable or responsible consumption.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Direct Applicability:** The reference paper's focus on healthcare makes its direct applicability to your research on consumer behavior limited. 
* **Need for Further Exploration:** To effectively utilize this paper, you would need to carefully analyze its findings and draw connections to the specific context of information-seeking and responsible consumption.

Combining the expectation-confirmation theory and the expectation-confirmation model and information systems continuance, we propose a model for social commerce, illustrating how social media is utilised in online shopping as a three-fold process (pre-purchase, purchase, and post-purchase stages) from a consumer perspective. The model consists of three phases: social commerce motivation, social commerce adoption, and e-commerce effectiveness. Using two rounds of surveys, we find that (1) autonomous motivation and controlled motivation have positive effects on social commerce information seeking and sharing, and (2) social commerce information seeking formulates consumers’ pre-purchase decisions, thus affecting their actual purchase outcomes, repurchase intentions, and social commerce information-sharing intentions in the post-purchase stage. In addition, our study indicates that consumers may play dual roles in social commerce: as information seekers in the pre-purchase stage and as information providers in the post-purchase stage.

While the reference paper focuses on social commerce and doesn't explicitly address sustainable or responsible consumption, it offers valuable insights into **information seeking behaviors** within an online shopping context.  

Here's how you could potentially utilize it:

* **Comparative Analysis:** You could compare and contrast the information-seeking motivations and processes described in the reference paper with those of consumers engaged in responsible consumption. This could highlight similarities and differences in how information is sought and used in these two contexts.
* **Expanding on Information Types:** The reference paper discusses consumers as both information seekers and providers. This concept could be relevant to your research by exploring the types of information consumers seek regarding responsible consumption and how they might share this information with others.
* **Social Media Influence:** The paper's focus on social media's role in shaping consumer behavior could be relevant if your research explores the influence of social media on responsible consumption decisions.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Direct Applicability:**  Keep in mind that the reference paper's findings are not directly transferable to your specific focus on responsible consumption. You'll need to carefully consider how the insights on information seeking in social commerce can be adapted and applied to your research context.
* **Additional Research:** To strengthen the connection, you might need to supplement the reference paper with additional research that directly addresses information seeking and responsible consumption.

While the reference paper doesn't directly focus on sustainable or responsible consumption, it delves into consumer search behavior and the utilization of refinement tools on e-commerce platforms. This aspect could be valuable to your research in the following ways:

* **Understanding Search Behaviors:** The paper's findings on how consumers use refinement tools and navigate product information could shed light on the information-seeking processes relevant to your study. You could draw parallels between general search behaviors and how consumers might seek information about ethical aspects of products.
* **Identifying Information Barriers:** The paper mentions that not all refinement tools are effectively used for optimizing decisions. This suggests potential information barriers that consumers face, which aligns with your interest in how information barriers influence responsible consumption.
* **Informing Decision-Support Tools:** The paper's recommendations for platform design and functionality improvements could inspire ideas for developing decision-support tools that address information gaps and promote responsible consumption.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Contextual Differences:** Remember that the reference paper focuses on general e-commerce behavior, not specifically on sustainable or ethical products. You'll need to carefully consider how its findings translate to the context of your research.
* **Limited Scope:** The paper primarily examines product-level search behavior. While relevant, it might not offer insights into broader information-seeking processes related to ethical considerations.



Overall, the reference paper offers some potentially useful insights into consumer search behaviors and information barriers, which could indirectly inform your research on information-seeking processes and responsible consumption.

Might greenwashing have the potential to place an invisible shackle on circular economy and sustainable development? Exploring this rather unconventional premise, the study investigates how greenwashing relates to circularity and sustainability, seeking to unravel the intertwined connection between them. In a novel proposition, this study suggests that greenwashing is closely related with SDG12, and consequently acts as a barrier to circular economy and sustainable development. The specific aim of the study is to determine how consumer-sector greenwashing affects sustainable consumption and production and how it impacts SDG12. This study critically reviews multiple greenwashing cases across four prominent consumer goods sectors: automotive, bottled water, garments, and processed food. The review characterizes the impact of greenwashing on sustainability. Three specific impact avenues by which greenwashing affects SDG12 are identified, each corresponding to a major facet of the goal. Through a critical analysis of the 11 targets of SDG12, this study finds six to be directly hampered by greenwashing. Moreover, limitations of SDG12 are observed, most notably in that SDG12 undervalues the role of businesses and customers, has targets and indicators that do not properly encompass its essence, prioritizes outcomes without building pathways, and lacks specific directives against greenwashing at the global institutional level. Recommendations across institutional, managerial, and societal spheres are discussed. The study highlights the role of businesses in achieving sustainability and emphasizes the need for policy to deter greenwashing.

The reference paper focuses on greenwashing, which directly relates to **information asymmetries** between businesses and consumers. Greenwashing creates a situation where businesses present misleading information about the sustainability of their products, obscuring the true environmental and ethical impact. This lack of transparency acts as a barrier to informed decision-making for consumers who are seeking to engage in responsible consumption.

Here's how you can utilize this paper in your research:

* **Support your argument:** The paper provides evidence and examples of how greenwashing practices create information asymmetries, hindering consumers' ability to accurately assess the ethical and sustainable aspects of products. This directly supports your argument about the role of information barriers in shaping responsible consumption.
* **Expand on information barriers:** While your paper focuses on broader information access and transparency, the reference paper delves into a specific type of information barrier – greenwashing. You can cite this paper to illustrate the nuanced ways in which misleading information can impede responsible consumption.
* **Highlight the need for solutions:** Both papers emphasize the need to address information asymmetries to foster responsible consumption. You can connect your call for improved information systems and decision-support tools with the reference paper's recommendations for policy interventions to deter greenwashing.

Despite companies' efforts to decouple the pursuit of growth from its negative impacts, a more sufficiency-driven approach seems imperative to curb consumerism and contribute more effectively to sustainability. This study draws on the literature to build a three-pillar framework of potential strategies to enable fashion companies to foster sufficient consumption and reduce dependence on the sale of new items, with benefits expected for both consumers and companies. Subsequently, it uses multiple case study to examine qualitatively the annual reports issued during 2013–2014 and 2020–2021 by a sample of ten top companies in this segment. The goal is to assess whether these companies are embracing such strategies, what (if any) evolution occurs between these two periods, whether the 2030 Agenda with its SDG12 ‘Responsible consumption and production’ plays a mediating role in their adoption, and what is the logic behind such evolution. The results show that, although such adoption is gaining momentum, companies tend first to embrace strategies with less impact on their traditional modus operandi. Further, the laxity of SDG12 enables companies to profess commitment even when not addressing any of the strategies to foster sufficient consumption. This study aims to give actors critical awareness of this issue and provide practical guidance for managers to adopt and combine these strategies decisively to fully embrace the principles of circular economy and a more holistic approach to sustainability. It also advises companies to avoid the risk of ‘anti-consumerist washing’—a newly identified variant of greenwashing—and proposes to study a ‘hierarchical pyramid of business strategies to rationalize consumption’. © 2023 The Authors",Anti-consumerist washing; Business strategy; Circular economy; Fast fashion; Sufficient consumption; Sustainability,Air navigation; Strategic planning; Sustainable development; Anti-consumerist washing; Business models; Business strategy; Circular economy; Fashion companies; Fashion industry; Fast fashion; Model-based OPC; Multiple-case study; Sufficient consumption; Washing,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85150765058,Possibly,"Sustainability, Asymmetries, Possibly Availability","
While the reference paper focuses on the fashion industry and ""sufficient consumption,"" it touches upon several themes relevant to your research:

* **Sustainability:** The paper directly addresses sustainable practices within the fast fashion industry, aligning with your broader interest in responsible consumption. You could cite it to provide context on the challenges of promoting sustainability in a consumption-driven sector.
* **Asymmetries:** The paper highlights ""greenwashing"" and the ""laxity of SDG12,"" suggesting information asymmetries between fashion companies and consumers. This aligns with your interest in information barriers and how they can hinder responsible consumption. You could use this paper to support your argument about the need for transparent information systems.
* **Possibly Availability:** The paper discusses strategies companies are adopting to foster ""sufficient consumption,"" some of which might involve making information about product lifecycles, ethical sourcing, or environmental impact more accessible. While not the paper's central focus, this aspect could be relevant to your research on information availability.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Specificity:** The reference paper's focus on the fashion industry might limit its direct applicability to your broader research on information-seeking and responsible consumption. You'll need to carefully assess whether its findings and insights can be generalized to other consumption contexts.
* **Primary Focus:** The paper's primary focus is on company strategies rather than consumer information-seeking behaviors. While it touches on information asymmetries, it doesn't delve deeply into the consumer perspective, which is central to your research.



**In Conclusion:**

The reference paper offers some potentially valuable insights related to sustainability, information asymmetries, and possibly information availability. However, its specific focus on the fashion industry and limited attention to consumer information-seeking behaviors mean you should use it judiciously and supplement it with other sources that more directly address your research questions."

In this context, we investigate the hindsight bias, i.e., consumers think in hindsight that they knew what would happen all along, may lead consumers to think they evaluated attributes of unsustainable or sustainable products correctly all the time while they did not, devaluating downstream marketing variables. This paper experimentally investigates the hindsight bias by manipulating information about a products' sustainability. We focus on two perspectives about hindsight biases, namely, marketing and psychology, to explore the interaction of surprise and sustainability. In a set of two online studies (Study 1: n = 300; Study 2: n = 461), we found a group-based hindsight bias for high-involvement, unsustainable products (Study 1) and individual hindsight biases for low-involvement, unsustainable and sustainable products (Study 2). Contributing to both, mostly separately researched perspectives, we conclude that neither is predominantly correct. Instead, both perspectives jointly determine why consumers evaluate products differently. Confronted with surprising, sustainable information about unsustainable products causes a hindsight bias that increases purchase intention and word of mouth. In contrast, surprising, unsustainable information about sustainable products show opposed effects. Implications for marketing practice show when product information can unintentionally cause greenwashing and how product information should be communicated to underline a product's sustainability. © 2023 The Authors.

While the reference paper doesn't directly focus on information-seeking processes, it offers valuable insights into how information availability and asymmetries influence consumer perceptions of sustainability. 

Here's how you can utilize it:

* **Support your argument on information barriers:** The reference paper demonstrates how ""surprising"" information about a product's sustainability can trigger hindsight bias, leading to potentially inaccurate evaluations. This supports your argument that information barriers and lack of transparency can hinder consumers from making informed decisions about responsible consumption.
* **Illustrate the impact of greenwashing:** The paper highlights how  ""surprising, unsustainable information about sustainable products"" can lead to negative consequences. This aligns with your focus on the need for improved information systems and decision-support tools to combat greenwashing and promote transparency.
* **Expand on the ""information availability"" aspect:** You can draw upon the reference paper's findings to further elaborate on the concept of information availability in your own work. Discuss how the type and presentation of information can influence consumer behavior and decision-making regarding responsible consumption.

Despite this emphasis, studies have consistently revealed a significant gap between individuals' intentions to be socially responsible and their actual purchasing behaviors: they often choose products that do not align with their values. This paper aims to investigate the role of ""search""and it how influences this gap. Our investigation involves an online survey of 286 participants, where we inquire about their search behaviors and whether they considered various dimensions - ranging from price and features to environmental, social, and governance issues - in relation to a recent purchase. Contrary to expectations of a clear intention-behavior gap, our findings suggest most participants exhibited indifference or lack of awareness regarding these ""responsible""aspects. While, for those participants who were more ethically minded, they reported difficulties related to searching for and acquiring information regarding such aspects, which contributed to the gap. Our findings suggests that part of the intention-behaviour gap can be framed as an information seeking problem. Moreover our findings motivate the development of search systems and platforms that better help support consumers make more informed and responsible purchasing decisions. © 2024 ACM.",Ethical Consumerism; Product Search; Shopping,Sales; Search engines; Ethical consumerism; Information seeking; Online surveys; Product search; Purchasing behaviors; Purchasing decisions; Search behavior; Search system; Shopping; Philosophical aspects,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85188669487,Yes,"Information seeking, availability","
This reference paper is highly relevant to your research for several reasons:

While many environmental groups use the concept widely to criticise the ‘optics’ strategies of organisations wanting to improve their image while maintaining a business-as-usual approach, it has largely been ignored in Geography and related disciplines. This paper argues that we need to take greenwashing seriously. It develops a broad concept of greenwashing, suggesting that the processes of obscuring social and ecological relations via greenwashing are central to the (dis)functioning of contemporary capitalism.

While the reference paper doesn't directly focus on information-seeking processes or information availability, it highlights a crucial aspect related to your research: **information asymmetries created through greenwashing**.

The paper argues that greenwashing obscures social and ecological realities, creating a situation where consumers lack access to accurate and transparent information about a company's sustainability practices. This directly relates to the ""information barriers"" you mention in your abstract.

Here's how you could utilize this paper:

* **Support your argument about information barriers:** The reference paper provides a theoretical framework for understanding how greenwashing practices contribute to information asymmetries, hindering consumers' ability to make informed decisions about responsible consumption.
* **Expand on the consequences of information asymmetries:** The paper discusses how greenwashing ultimately undermines the functioning of ""green"" capitalism and sustainable development. You could draw upon this to emphasize the broader societal implications of inadequate information access for responsible consumption.
* **Highlight the need for solutions:** By showcasing the negative impacts of greenwashing, the paper reinforces the importance of your call for improved information systems and decision-support tools to address these information asymmetries and foster genuine responsible consumption.

While incorporating blockchain technology has significantly enhanced the trans-parency and verifiability of these certificates, it has also intro-duced a trade-off in terms of increased operational costs due to the added control mechanisms of the blockchain. This challenge led to recent advancements in the state-of-the-art blockchain-based framework for verifiable green energy certificates, integrating trustworthy registries to balance trust and operational efficiency to enhance feasibility for real-world deployments. Our paper extended the same framework to elevate the trust factor without incurring additional operational costs of blockchain.

Sustainable marketing is used by many companies that “rely” on the principles of sustainable development in their activities, strive to implement rational production and model rational consumption among their consumers. Other companies mimic the former with greenwashing. As a result, consumers lose confidence in companies, their declared values of sustainability and the principles of sustainable development in general. Therefore, responsible companies need to not only promote new products to market through sustainable marketing but also educate consumers to recognise unfair greenwashing practices by other manufacturers. By increasing the competence of consumers, companies will be able not only to reduce the negative effect of unfair product promotion practices but also help build confidence among consumers by modelling rational consumption. Purpose of the research: to conceptually substantiate modelling the rational consumption based on taking into account the levels of consumer competencies and their impact on the conscious choice of the “green product” by contributing to the creation of a culture of sustainable consumption about society. Methods: theoretical analysis, scientific synthesis, scientific adaptation, discourse analysis, scientific generalisation. Results and novelty: a conceptual justification of a sustainable consumption model has been developed by demonstrating the need and sufficiency of the relationships with consumers with various competencies for their education based on the information content about the sustainability of companies and their products, which helps to strengthen the values of sustainable development and reduce the negative effects of greenwashing. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Green economy; Green marketing; Greenwashing; Sustainable development,,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125288447,Yes,"Asymmetries, Availability, Sustainability","
This paper, while not directly focused on information-seeking processes, offers valuable insights that can complement your research in several ways:

* **Information Asymmetries and Greenwashing:** The reference paper highlights the issue of greenwashing and how it creates information asymmetries between companies and consumers.

While the reference paper doesn't directly focus on information-seeking processes like your study, it touches upon relevant themes:

* **Asymmetries:** The paper discusses ""greenwashing"" which is a prime example of information asymmetry. Companies might present themselves as more environmentally friendly than they actually are, misleading consumers. This aligns with your interest in information barriers and how they can hinder responsible consumption. You could cite this paper to illustrate the real-world consequences of information asymmetry in the context of sustainability.

* **Sustainability:** The paper investigates the impact of government's perceived ecological roles on consumers' pro-environmental attitudes and green consumerism. This indirectly relates to your focus on responsible consumption. You could use this paper to support the broader context of increasing consumer demand for sustainable products and practices, driven in part by government initiatives and consumer awareness.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Limited Direct Relevance:** The reference paper's primary focus is on the influence of government perception and greenwashing on consumer behavior, not on the information-seeking processes themselves. 
* **Potential for Contextualization:**  You can still utilize this paper by drawing connections between its findings on greenwashing and information asymmetry, and your own research on how information barriers impact responsible consumption.

This paper analyses an acceptance model using extended TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) with Trust as an added external variable. It was suggested that Trust indirectly influences the final Intention to Use with the perceptions of Utility and Ease of Use. To test the proposed model, a survey was carried out with users from different geographical areas of Spain (n = 445). The second aim of this study was to understand the complexity of marketing segmentation by separating the application users into different user groups. Users were grouped by their preference of favorite Internet search engine. Unobserved heterogeneity was studied using FIMIX-PLS, and three different user behaviours with search engines were identified. These corresponded to the number of inhabitants who live in the user area. In this way, the impact that the environment has on user choice, acceptance, and use of this type of sustainable applications was shown. The results were checked using PLS-SEM and showed that the model for the adoption of sustainable search engines is explanatory and predictive because confidence and acceptance for this TAM were validated. The conclusions are interesting for developers of environmentally sustainable and responsible applications which want to coincide with current trends to ensure that users prefer them. © 2018 Pedro Palos-Sanchez et al.",,Behavioral research; Information retrieval; Acceptance models; Geographical area; Intention to use; Internet search engine; Paper analysis; Technology acceptance model; Unobserved heterogeneity; User behaviour; Search engines,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056221514,Possibly,"Sustainability, Possibly Availability","

However, little is known about whether searching online resources actually improves consumers' understanding of health issues. Objectives: The aim was to study whether searching on the World Wide Web improves consumers' accuracy in answering health questions and whether consumers' understanding of health issues is subject to further change under social feedback. Methods: This was a pre/post prospective online study. A convenience sample of 227 undergraduate students was recruited from the population of the University of New South Wales. Subjects used a search engine that retrieved online documents from PubMed, MedlinePlus, and HealthInsite and answered a set of six questions (before and after use of the search engine) designed for health care consumers. They were then presented with feedback consisting of a summary of the post-search answers provided by previous subjects for the same questions and were asked to answer the questions again. Results: There was an improvement in the percentage of correct answers after searching (pre-search 61.2% vs post-search 82.0%, P <.001) and after feedback with other subjects' answers (pre-feedback 82.0% vs post-feedback 85.3%, P =.051). The proportion of subjects with highly confident correct answers (ie, confident or very confident) and the proportion with highly confident incorrect answers significantly increased after searching (correct pre-search 61.6% vs correct post-search 95.5%, P <.001; incorrect pre-search 55.3% vs incorrect post-search 82.0%, P <.001). Subjects who were not as confident in their post-search answers were 28.5% more likely than those who were confident or very confident to change their answer after feedback with other subjects' post-search answers (χ21= 66.65, P <.001). Conclusions: Searching across quality health information sources on the Web can improve consumers' accuracy in answering health questions.

* **Supporting your argument on the importance of information seeking:** The study demonstrates that searching for information online can lead to improved understanding and accuracy in answering questions. This supports your argument that information-seeking processes play a crucial role in shaping consumer decisions, even in the context of responsible consumption.
* **Highlighting the potential impact of information quality:** The paper shows that while searching can improve accuracy, confidence in answers is not always a reliable indicator of correctness. This raises important questions about the quality and reliability of information sources related to responsible consumption. You could use this to emphasize the need for trustworthy and transparent information systems in your research.
* **Drawing parallels to consumer behavior:** Although the context is different, the study's findings on the influence of social feedback on consumer answers could be relevant to your research. You could explore whether similar social influences (e.g., online reviews, peer recommendations) impact consumer decisions related to responsible consumption.

A steep rise in user interest was recorded, despite vendor cautioning of limited user feedback. The study presented a phenomenological analysis of MXP experiences amongst recreational drug users as posted on public Internet fora. Internet searches were carried out using specific key words; “methoxphenidine,” “MXP” and in combination with “experience,” “report,” “forum,” and “trip.” Seven self-reported experiences and 28 thread discussions relating sole use of MXP were analyzed using the Empirical Phenomenological Psychological method. Five themes and 61 categories emerged. MXP is marketed as a legal replacement for MXE, diphenidine, and ketamine, with a dissociative and stimulant wave outcome often lasting for days. Harm reduction tactics, awareness of prior tolerance to dissociative and optimal settings for use are discussed. Acute side-effects relate to hypertension and seizures.

While the reference paper focuses on the consumption of a synthetic drug (MXP) and harm reduction practices within online communities, it offers some tangential insights that *could* be relevant to your research on information-seeking and responsible consumption. 

Here's how:

* **Information Seeking in Niche Communities:** The paper highlights how online drug forums serve as platforms for information exchange about a specific product (MXP). This could be drawn upon to illustrate how consumers in niche markets, even those involving potentially harmful products, actively seek information to inform their purchasing decisions. You could discuss this as a parallel to consumers seeking information about ethically sourced or sustainable products.
* **User-Generated Content and Trust:** The study emphasizes the role of user-generated content (experiences, reports) in shaping perceptions and decisions within the online drug community. This connects to the broader discussion of how consumers rely on online reviews, testimonials, and social media for information about products and brands, including those related to responsible consumption.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Contextual Differences:** It's crucial to acknowledge the significant differences between the context of drug consumption and responsible consumption. The motivations, risks, and ethical considerations are vastly different.  
* **Limited Direct Applicability:** The reference paper doesn't directly address sustainable or ethical consumption practices. Its value lies in offering potential insights into information-seeking behaviors within specific online communities.

**Recommendation:**

You could briefly mention the reference paper as an example of how online communities facilitate information exchange and influence consumer decisions, even in contexts outside of sustainable consumption. However, avoid overstating its relevance or drawing direct parallels that could be misleading."

The building sector consumes 40% of resources globally, produces 40% of global waste and 33% of greenhouse gas emissions. The transition towards a Circular Economy (CE) in the built environment is vital to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of climate action and responsible consumption and production. Metrics are needed to support this transition; previous work identified Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as the best method to analyse the environmental performance of the CE. However, current LCA methods focus on the individual system, considering a single lifecycle. Circular assessment requires a systems-perspective: buildings, components, parts and materials have multiple lifecycles. Thus, questions arise about how benefits and burdens should be allocated between systems. Method. In this study, we compare the potential influence of applying different allocation approaches in LCA method. We calculate the environmental impacts of two 'circular building components': (1) a concrete column designed for direct reuse and (2) a recyclable roof felt. We applied four allocation approaches: (a) the cut-off approach stated in EN 15804/15978, (b) the Circular Footprint Formula (CFF) from the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF), (c) the 50:50 approach, and (d) the linearly degressive (LD) approach. Results. The allocation approaches resulted in notable differences in impact distributions thereby incentivising different CE principles (narrowing, slowing and closing). Due to the long lifespan of building components, concerns regarding uncertainty and 'green-washing' resulting from allocation of impacts between cycles arise. However, the LD approach was, for closed-loop systems (such as the ones assessed here), found to be promising: it is simple to use; it creates incentives for narrowing, slowing and closing loops and to design for these in the future; it deals with the uncertainty, material quality and number of use cycles. Conclusion. The comparison of allocation approaches and first recommendation on an allocation approach provides an important step towards circular life cycle assessment and, subsequently, helps promote the CE concept within the building industry. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Building components; Closed loop systems; Construction industry; Ecodesign; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Sustainable development; Uncertainty analysis; Allocation approach; Building industry; Built environment; Circular economy; Environmental footprints; Environmental performance; Individual systems; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097156594,Possibly,Sustainability,"
While the reference paper focuses on circular economy practices within the built environment, it touches upon a relevant aspect for your research: the importance of sustainable practices.  

Here's how you could potentially utilize it:

* **Supporting Argument:** You could cite this paper to bolster your argument about the need for improved information systems and decision-support tools. The reference paper highlights the complexity of assessing environmental impacts in a circular economy, emphasizing the need for robust methodologies and data. This aligns with your point about the importance of accessible and transparent information for consumers making responsible choices.
* **Broader Context:** You could briefly mention this paper to provide context about the wider movement towards sustainable practices in various sectors, including construction. This helps demonstrate that your focus on information-seeking and responsible consumption is part of a larger, ongoing conversation.

While the reference paper focuses on jute fibers in geotextiles, it touches upon a few points that could be tangentially relevant to your research:

* **Demand Network and Information Systems:** The paper proposes a shift from a supply chain to a demand network using information systems for jute geotextiles. This concept aligns with your interest in information availability and its influence on responsible consumption. You could draw a parallel, arguing that improved information systems in other sectors (beyond jute geotextiles) could similarly empower consumers to make more responsible choices.
* **Value Chain and Profitability:** The paper highlights how better information access can increase profitability for stakeholders in the jute geotextile industry. You could connect this to your argument that accessible information about ethical aspects of products can drive consumer demand and, consequently, benefit businesses that prioritize responsible practices.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Specificity:** The reference paper's focus on jute geotextiles is quite specific.  You'll need to carefully extract the broader concepts relevant to your research on information seeking and responsible consumption in general.
* **Limited Direct Relevance:** The paper doesn't directly address information seeking behaviors or barriers related to sustainable consumption. Its relevance is more conceptual and requires some interpretation and extrapolation on your part.

Recent research has shown that the attributes' impact on the choice depends on their availability in memory. More precisely, retrieving information about an attribute gives the attribute a higher impact on the choice. These recent findings on the importance of memory availability for the decision-making process offer a new, and so far, unexplored opportunity to guide consumers' decision making. In the present study, we used eye tracking to explore how the availability of information drives consumers' information search and choice behavior. We found that making attribute information available in memory with a so-called retro-cue increased the probability of choosing the product recommended by the attribute and led to increased information search and subsequent choices in line with a compensatory decision strategy.

To understand how much consumers search for such information online on one Internet search engine, whether they mention such information in social media and how positively they view this information. Setting and design: A leading Internet search engine (Google) was the main focus of the study. Google Trends and Google Adwords keyword analyses were performed for national and Californian searches between 1 August 2012 and 31 July 2013 for keywords related to 'top hospital' , best hospital', and 'hospital quality ', as well as for six specific hospital quality reports. Separately, a proprietary social media monitoring tool was used to investigate blog, forum, social media and traditional media mentions of, and sentiment towards, major public reports of hospital quality in California in 2012. Primary outcome measures: (1) Counts of searches for keywords performed on Google; (2) counts of and (3) sentiment of mentions of public reports on social media. Results: National Google search volume for 75 hospital quality-related terms averaged 610 700 searches per month with strong variation by keyword and by state. A commercial report (Healthgrades) was more commonly searched for nationally on Google than the federal government's Hospital Compare, which otherwise dominated quality-related search terms. Social media references in California to quality reports were generally few, and commercially produced hospital quality reports were more widely mentioned than state (Office of Statewide Healthcare Planning and Development (OSHPD)), or non-profit (CalHospitalCompare) reports.

While the reference paper focuses on hospital quality reports rather than sustainable or ethical consumption, it offers valuable insights into **information availability** and its influence on consumer behavior.  

Here's how you could utilize it:

* **Comparative Analysis:** You could draw parallels between the information-seeking patterns observed in the reference paper (regarding hospital quality) and potential information-seeking behaviors related to sustainable consumption.  Do consumers exhibit similar search trends when looking for information about ethical products or brands?
* **Highlighting Barriers:** The reference paper discusses the varying levels of awareness and search volume for different types of hospital quality reports. This could inspire you to explore potential barriers to accessing information about sustainable or ethical consumption. Are certain types of information (e.g., certifications, supply chain details) harder to find than others?
* **Supporting Arguments:** The reference paper's findings on the limited social media mentions of publicly available hospital quality reports could support your argument about the need for improved information systems and decision-support tools to promote responsible consumption.

**Important Note:**

While the reference paper offers some relevant insights, it's crucial to acknowledge the differences in context. Hospital quality reports are often standardized and regulated, whereas information about sustainable consumption can be more fragmented and subject to greenwashing.  Therefore, use the reference paper cautiously and focus on the transferable aspects related to information availability and consumer behavior."

Aim: The purpose of this review was to explore if/how label information impacts consumer decision-making about food, over-The-counter drugs, and natural health products/dietary supplements and to make recommendations about how this evidence may be applied to natural health products/dietary supplements. Method: A narrative analysis of a systematic review was performed. Medline and Embase databases were systematically searched to identify relevant studies from 1985 to February 2018 for all available English-language articles. This was supplemented with hand searches of the reference lists of review articles. Results: One hundred and fifty-one studies met the inclusion criteria, and after excluding review articles, 127 were included in the analysis. The findings from the studies were categorized into three main themes: (1) impact of labeling on consumer behavior (the majority of studies found that changes in label format or information had little to no effect on consumer behavior such as purchasing); (2) consumer comprehension of label information (significant proportions of consumers were unable to accurately interpret information found on natural health product/dietary supplement, over-The-counter medication, or food labels); and (3) label formatting/design, including standardization of information in fact tables (standardization, front-of-pack, and contrasting color panels were preferred and best attracted consumer attention). Conclusions: Many consumers did not regularly read product labels, nor understand the information they read on those labels. There was evidence that consistency of information was preferred by many consumers. Font size clearly impacted consumers' ability to read and understand the information on labels and this needed to be balanced with the amount of information required on labels. There was evidence that symbols that are simple and used sparingly are helpful in providing direction to consumers.

While the reference paper focuses on labeling of natural health products and dietary supplements, it touches upon a relevant aspect for your research: **information availability and its impact on consumer behavior.**  

The study highlights that many consumers struggle to understand label information and that label changes alone often don't significantly impact behavior. This finding aligns with your interest in how information barriers can shape the valuation of ethical aspects during consumption decisions.

You could utilize this paper in the following ways:

* **Supporting your argument:** The reference paper provides evidence that simply making information available (through labels) is not enough to drive responsible consumption. This supports your argument that accessible and transparent information is crucial.
* **Expanding on information barriers:** The paper identifies consumer comprehension as a barrier. You could draw parallels to other types of information barriers relevant to sustainable and ethical consumption, such as lack of access to reliable information sources or difficulty in comparing product sustainability claims.
* **Highlighting the need for better information systems:** The reference paper's conclusion about the need for improved label design and information presentation resonates with your call for better information systems and decision-support tools to foster responsible consumption.

While the reference paper focuses on analyzing text related to green supply chain practices in healthcare, it touches upon a relevant theme: the **availability of information** about sustainable practices.  

Here's how it could be potentially useful:

* **Supporting Argument:** You could cite this paper to support your argument about the importance of accessible information for responsible consumption. The paper demonstrates the need for systems to extract and make information about sustainable practices readily available.
* **Contextualizing Information Barriers:** The paper's focus on text analysis highlights the challenges of extracting relevant information from large datasets. This could be used to contextualize the information barriers consumers face when trying to make responsible consumption choices.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Direct Applicability:** The reference paper is not directly about consumer information-seeking behaviors related to responsible consumption. Its focus is on analyzing information within the healthcare industry, not on consumer decision-making.
* **Limited Scope:** The paper primarily addresses the technical aspects of information extraction, not the behavioral or psychological factors influencing how consumers use information. 


Therefore, while the reference paper offers some tangential support for your arguments about information availability, it's not a core reference for your study on information-seeking processes and responsible consumption."

The evaluation stage involves the selection of one option among a set of alternatives by using a specifi c decision strategy or a combination of multiple strategies. Vermeir, Van Kenhove, and Hendrickx (2002: 709) underline the major role of decision strategies in consumer DM: “another important factor of the DMP is the use of decision rules [strategies].

While the reference paper doesn't directly address sustainable or responsible consumption, it delves into ""decision strategies in tourism evaluation,"" which includes the ""search for information"" stage. This stage is directly relevant to your paper's focus on information-seeking processes and their influence on responsible consumption.

Here's how you could potentially utilize this reference:

* **Theoretical Framework:** The paper discusses various decision strategies consumers employ during the evaluation stage. You could explore whether these strategies apply to decisions involving responsible consumption and how information seeking might influence the choice of strategy.
* **Comparative Analysis:**  You could compare and contrast the information-seeking behaviors of tourists (as discussed in the reference paper) with those of consumers making decisions about ethically responsible products or services. This could highlight similarities and differences in information needs and search patterns.
* **Expanding on Information Seeking:** The reference paper might offer insights into different types of information sought by consumers during decision-making, which could be helpful in understanding the specific information needs related to responsible consumption.

Greenwashing is a phenomenon used by companies to sell their products. Through stratified (probability) and purposive and convenience (non-probability) sampling techniques, an online survey was circulated to gather information from 768 participants from the UK, Canada, and Pakistan to determine consumers’ perspectives on subjects including awareness, trust, and effectiveness regarding greenwashed labelled products. The results were tested using the Chi-Square test for ranked data and structural equation modelling (SEM) for ordinal data. The study found that participants ranking themselves High environmentalists in comparison to Low and Moderate environmentalists, despite being skeptical, fall into the trap of identifying greenwashed products as sustainable. It has been proven that greenwashing negatively impacts the green purchasing behavior of the consumers. Participants reported that products are believed to be sustainable due to the overall perception of the product labelled as greenwashed. There is statistical evidence that purchase intent is not affected by greenwashing. It is also reported that younger people in comparison to older people have less trust and often believe greenwashing is problematic. Consumers were found to be vulnerable and more sensitive when their attention was drawn towards greenwashing.

This paper directly addresses the issue of information asymmetries in the context of sustainable consumption.  While your paper focuses on the broader impact of information-seeking processes, this reference paper provides concrete evidence of how greenwashing, a form of information asymmetry, can mislead consumers. 

Here's how you can utilize it:

* **Supporting Argument:** You can cite this paper to support your argument that information barriers, such as greenwashing, can hinder consumers from making truly responsible choices.
* **Illustrative Example:** The study's findings on how consumers, even those who consider themselves environmentally conscious, can be fooled by greenwashing can serve as a powerful example of the challenges consumers face in accessing reliable information.
* **Contextualizing Your Findings:** If your research finds that accessible and transparent information leads to greater prioritization of responsible aspects, you can contrast this with the reference paper's findings to highlight the importance of addressing information asymmetries.

**Additional Points:**

* While the reference paper focuses on environmental sustainability, the concept of greenwashing and information asymmetry is transferable to other areas of responsible consumption you might be exploring.
* Consider discussing the limitations of the reference paper's methodology (e.g., reliance on self-reported data) and how your research might address these limitations.

While the reference paper focuses on improving environmental attitudes through cueing existing ecological behaviors, it touches upon a concept relevant to your research: the influence of accessible information on shaping attitudes and behaviors related to sustainability.  

Here's how you could potentially utilize it:

* **Supporting Argument:** The reference paper's findings that cueing ecological behaviors can improve environmental attitudes indirectly supports your argument that accessible information can drive prioritization of responsible aspects. You could cite it as an example of how making relevant information readily available can positively influence consumer behavior.
* **Expanding on Information Availability:**  Although the reference paper doesn't directly address information barriers, its focus on ""cueing"" behaviors could be linked to the concept of information availability. You could discuss how making information about responsible consumption more salient and accessible, similar to how the study cues ecological behaviors, could lead to a shift in consumer priorities.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Direct vs. Indirect Relevance:** The reference paper's connection to your research is indirect. It doesn't directly address information-seeking processes or barriers as you define them.
* **Focus on Attitudes:** The primary focus of the reference paper is on attitudes, while your research emphasizes actual behaviors. While attitudes can influence behavior, the link isn't always straightforward.

While the reference paper doesn't directly focus on sustainable or responsible consumption, it offers valuable insights into **motivated information seeking** in the context of unethical behavior.  

Here's how you could potentially utilize it:

* **Expanding your understanding of information seeking motivations:** The paper highlights ""deonance"" and ""distrust-based threat monitoring"" as drivers for seeking information about unethical agents. This could enrich your analysis of why consumers might seek information about the ethical practices of companies, even if those practices aren't directly relevant to their immediate purchase decisions.
* **Connecting information seeking to ethical judgments:** The study demonstrates that even when information is irrelevant to a decision, people may still seek it out due to ethical concerns. This finding could support your argument that accessible information about ethical practices can influence consumer valuations, even among those with initially low ethical intentions.
* **Drawing parallels to responsible consumption:** Although the paper focuses on unethical behavior, you could draw parallels to responsible consumption by arguing that consumers might similarly seek information about sustainable practices due to deonance or a desire to monitor companies' ethical performance.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Contextual Differences:** Remember that the reference paper deals with unethical behavior in a general sense, while your focus is on responsible consumption. You'll need to carefully consider the applicability of the findings to your specific context.
* **Limited Scope:** The paper doesn't directly address information barriers or decision-support tools, which are central to your research. However, its insights into information seeking motivations could still be valuable in informing your discussion.

Within this approach, we estimate how respondents’ money- and health-consciousness affects their WTP for bread containing GMOs. Our findings are consistent with previous studies of Russian consumer preferences, who find that Russian consumers’ food purchases are often motivated by health concerns and the “naturalness” of foods. Our results indicate that information-seeking health-conscious consumers tend to be less likely to purchase GM foods, while more money-conscious consumers are more likely to purchase the GM product.

While the reference paper focuses on GMOs, which isn't directly aligned with your broader theme of socially and ethically responsible consumption, it does touch upon relevant aspects:

* **Information Availability:** The study investigates how information about GMOs (or lack thereof) influences consumer willingness to pay. This aligns with your interest in how information availability shapes responsible consumption decisions. You could draw parallels between the information barriers faced by consumers regarding GMOs and the barriers consumers might encounter when seeking information about other ethical aspects of products (e.g., fair trade, sustainability practices).
* **Sustainability (Tangentially):** Although GMOs are a complex issue with sustainability implications, the paper primarily focuses on consumer health concerns and price sensitivity. However, you could potentially use their findings on consumer segmentation (health-conscious vs. money-conscious) to consider how different consumer groups might prioritize information about various ethical aspects.

**How to Utilize:**

1. **Contrast and Compare:** Highlight the differences between GMO-related information seeking and information seeking related to other ethical consumption aspects. Discuss whether the findings on consumer segmentation (health vs. money) hold true for other ethical considerations.
2. **Support Your Argument:** Use the reference paper to support your argument about the importance of accessible and transparent information in driving responsible consumption.

The rate at which errors occur exerts an inordinate impact on the probative value of a DNA match. Previous research indicates that jurors are insensitive to this effect.

Jury-eligible adults (n = 568) read a synopsis of a rape trial in which the quantified error rate was manipulated (either 1-in-10 or 1-in-100), as was the vividness of an error (the laboratory technician was anecdotally portrayed as: sloppy, biased, both or none). Overall, both manipulations affected participants’ verdicts. However, numerate participants were affected by the quantified error rate but not anecdotal information, whereas innumerate participants were affected by anecdotal information but not the error rate.

This could be relevant to your research when considering how to present information about the ethical implications of products or services to consumers. 
* **Numeracy and Decision-Making:** The finding that numeracy levels impact how individuals interpret probabilistic information could be relevant to your study. You might consider exploring whether consumers with varying levels of numeracy differ in their information-seeking behaviors related to responsible consumption.
* **Cognitive Biases:** The study touches on cognitive biases related to information processing. You could draw parallels to potential biases that might influence consumers' information-seeking and decision-making processes regarding responsible consumption.

Design/methodology/ approach: The paper takes the form of a narrative review arising from the authors' presentation and subsequent discussions that took place during the Universities Council Symposium held in Vancouver, Canada in May 2011. Findings: There are a number of important factors that affect healthcare consumers' desire to seek information online about HAI, including the search engine used, the type of technology used, web site usability, information availability, consumers' learning style, consumers' personality traits, and finally, consumers' situational, emotional, and psychological contexts. These factors may affect healthcare consumers' decision making about where they will obtain healthcare (i.e. in their selection of a clinic, hospital, regional health authority and/or health care system). Research limitations/implications: HAI reporting via web sites is being done by health care organizations across North America. There is a need to more fully understand the factors that affect consumer use of these web sites. Practical implications: Fundamental questions have been raised about the impact of providing HAI information over the WWW. There is a need to consider the varying factors that influence consumers' information seeking involving the WWW (i.e. technology-driven and consumer-driven factors) especially when searching for HAI-related information about health care organizations. Originality/value: Historically, HAI information was the purview of those who had a background to interpret such data (e.g. infection control and public health practitioners).

However, it remains skeptical as to why the consumers are able to make purchase decisions in lack of personally experiencing the products. This study, on the basis of the Engel-Kollat-Blackwell Consumer Purchase Behavior Model (the EKB Model), attempted to explore the effects of the information search behavior in the context of the digital age on consumer decision making when buying apparel via the Internet. The sample consists of 344 with experience of buying apparel products via the Internet, and they were recruited from one of the most popular local online forums, in answer to the questionnaire by recall method. The study found that the information search behavior is related to the decision making, particularly in terms of fame information, visual information, comparison information, e-word-of-mouth information, and promotional information. Moreover, the results proved that personality traits, to some extent, affected the information search and decision making, except for the effects of the performance risk and the personal risk on the decision making. © 2017 IEEE.",consumer decision making; information search behavior; online apparel shopping; the EKB consumer purchase behavior model,Commerce; Decision making; Information retrieval; Purchasing; Sales; Behavior model; Consumer decision making; Consumer information; Information search behavior; online apparel shopping; Personality traits; Visual information; Word-of-mouth informations; Consumer behavior,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050668153,Possibly,Information seeking,"
While the reference paper focuses on online apparel shopping behavior and doesn't explicitly address sustainable or responsible consumption, it does delve into the **information search behaviors** of consumers in an online context. This aspect could be valuable to your research in the following ways:

* **Comparative Insights:** You could compare the information search patterns described in the reference paper with those of consumers seeking information about ethically responsible products. This comparison might reveal similarities or differences in how consumers approach information gathering depending on the product type and their ethical motivations.
* **Identifying Information Needs:** The reference paper highlights specific types of information consumers seek when buying apparel online (fame, visual, comparison, e-word-of-mouth, promotional).  You could explore whether similar information needs exist for consumers interested in responsible consumption and how those needs might be unique or overlapping.
* **Understanding Online Search Behaviors:** The paper's findings on the influence of personality traits on information search and decision-making could be relevant to your study if you are examining how individual differences influence information-seeking related to responsible consumption.

This paper touches upon the concept of greenwashing, which directly relates to information asymmetries between businesses and consumers. While it doesn't focus on information-seeking processes in the same way your paper does, it provides valuable insights into how misleading information (greenwashing) can impact consumer perceptions and trust in green products.

Here's how you could potentially utilize this paper:

* **Supporting Argument:** You could cite this paper to support your argument about the existence of information barriers and the need for improved transparency in information systems related to responsible consumption.
* **Contrasting Perspectives:** You could contrast the findings of this paper with your own, potentially highlighting how accessible and transparent information can counter the negative effects of greenwashing and empower consumers to make more informed decisions.
* **Expanding Discussion:** You could briefly discuss greenwashing as an example of an information asymmetry that your research aims to address through improved information access and decision-support tools.

The success of such an approach depends on the existence of a class of tourists who are not only motivated to take care of the natural surroundings of the host destination, whether they are traveling in an ecotourism or general tourism context, but also represent an economically attractive market segment. The aim of this study is to investigate whether there is empirical evidence for the existence of such a segment among the wider tourism population and, if so, how can it be characterized and thus marketed to. Willingness to pay is used as a criterion to define this segment, as it implicitly accounts for the trade-off that suggests environmental protection comes at a price. Results from the empirical survey study conducted in Australia indicate that environmentally responsible tourists who are willing to pay for environmental initiatives taken on by their tour operator can be characterized by a distinct profile with respect to travel information seeking, destination preferences, travel behavior, and willingness to pay-indicating that targeting such a segment of tourists in the general tourism context represents an attractive supplementary strategy to traditional supply-sided measures of sustainable destination management. © 2009 Cognizant Comm.

While the reference paper focuses on environmentally responsible tourism, it offers some potentially valuable insights for your research on information-seeking and socially/ethically responsible consumption. Here's how:

* **Information Seeking Profile:** The study identifies a distinct profile of ""environmentally responsible tourists"" based on their information-seeking behaviors. This could provide a starting point for understanding how information-seeking patterns might differ among consumers with varying levels of ethical intentions in a broader consumption context.

* **Willingness to Pay as a Proxy:** The paper uses willingness to pay as an indicator of environmental responsibility. You could explore whether a similar approach could be applied to other ethical aspects of consumption beyond environmental concerns.

* **Targeting Strategies:** The paper discusses how tour operators can target environmentally responsible tourists. This could inspire you to think about how information systems and decision-support tools could be designed to better reach and engage consumers who prioritize ethical considerations.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Contextual Differences:** Remember that the reference paper focuses specifically on tourism, which has unique characteristics. You'll need to carefully consider how its findings might translate to other consumption contexts.
* **Scope:** The paper primarily addresses environmental responsibility, whereas your research encompasses a broader range of ethical aspects. You'll need to be selective in how you utilize its insights.

Today’s consumers are engaging with enormous amount of narratives in form of online reviews. Consumers use stories to give meaning to their product experiences and make decisions (Nielsen and Escalas 2010). They read and process stories shared by other consumers to shape their own judgements. Nevertheless, our understanding of how different individuals process narratives and the mechanism that underlies their diverse behaviour is very limited. This research aims to examine how different segments of consumers evaluate online reviews that are written in a narrative form. Drawing on marketing and decision science literature, it suggests that consumers’ decision-making style (e.g. maximizers and satisficers) explains their information usage behaviour and evaluation strategies (Schwartz et al. 2000; Karimi et al. 2015). It can therefore influence the way narratives are processed. In order to test the relationship between consumers’ decision-making style, evaluation strategy and narrative processing behaviour, video recording techniques were used. Ninety-five participants were recruited and exposed to a number of reviews in a laboratory environment. As they were interacting with online product reviews, their information processing behaviour and verbal protocols were recorded. Findings revealed that decision-making style of consumers has a significant effect on their information processing behaviour. The relation between the decision-making style and information processing behaviour is mediated by the evaluation strategy they adopt. That is, satisficers are more prone to adopting a holistic approach to product evaluation which leads to analytical information processing, whereas maximizers tend to focus on detailed evaluation of product attributes that can prompt narrative processing behaviour.

While the reference paper doesn't directly focus on sustainable or responsible consumption, it offers valuable insights into how different consumer decision-making styles (maximizers vs. satisficers) influence their information processing behavior. This could be relevant to your research in the following ways:

* **Understanding information seeking patterns:** The paper suggests that maximizers tend towards detailed, analytical processing of information, potentially including narratives. This could imply that they are more likely to engage in in-depth information seeking about ethical aspects of products. Conversely, satisficers might rely on more holistic evaluations and potentially be less inclined to actively seek out detailed ethical information.
* **Tailoring information delivery:** Your research emphasizes the importance of accessible and transparent information. The reference paper's findings could inform strategies for tailoring information delivery based on consumer decision-making styles. For example, providing concise summaries of ethical information for satisficers while offering in-depth reports for maximizers could enhance the effectiveness of information dissemination.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Contextual Differences:** Remember that the reference paper focuses on general product reviews, not specifically on ethical or sustainable consumption. The findings may need to be interpreted cautiously within the context of your research.
* **Further Investigation:**  Consider exploring whether other studies have investigated the link between decision-making styles and information seeking related to responsible consumption. This could provide more direct support for your arguments.

Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory qualitative research has been carried out, conducting 12 individual face-to-face, semi-structured, in-depth interviews with social media users, followed by a qualitative thematic analysis. Findings: Social media transform the consumers’ hotel decision journey by influencing the way consumers search, decide and book hotels. The findings reveal the determinants shaping this process, by shedding light on the perceived value of using social media, consumers’ information search behaviour “then and now”, the advantages and disadvantages of social media use for decision-making, their trustworthiness and the factors that influence the consumers’ hotel decision-journey. The findings are conceptualised in an integrated theoretical model, entitled “hotel consumer decision-journey through social media”. Research limitations/implications: The study’s scope for qualitative in-depth insights into the “hotel consumer decision-journey through social media” asked for a compromise on a larger sample size and in turn the transferability of the theoretical model beyond service, hospitality and tourism consumer decision-making contexts. Practical implications: This paper provides strategic implications for hospitality marketing and management for a better understanding of the influence of social media on the hotel customer decision journey. The study shows that a variety of social media with associated content sources and levels add to the complexity of hotel-related information search and decision behaviour. The developed framework not only helps hotel professionals understand consumers’ different levels (e.g. type of content, content source, content level) through which social media might influence decision-making. Various real-life scenarios presented also help practitioners understand the fine nuances of how consumers are influenced by social media and how this causes them to iteratively change their minds and make a final decision towards the rejection or selection of a hotel. Originality/value: Consumers use social media for a wide spectrum of scenarios in tourism and hospitality, while the influence of social media on the consumers’ hotel decision-making process remains little understood. This study makes a theoretical contribution in that it addresses these existing gaps and bridges consumer behaviour and social media literature in the hotel context to shed light on the “hotel consumer decision journey through social media”. The core contribution is an integrated theoretical model and real-life scenarios that depict the impact of social media on the hotel decision-making. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Consumer decision journey; Decision-making; Hospitality; Hotel decision journey; Social media,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019584172,Possibly,Information Seeking,"
While the reference paper focuses on hotel decision-making influenced by social media, it touches upon aspects relevant to your research on information-seeking and responsible consumption:

* **Information Search Behavior:** The paper explores how consumers search for information about hotels using social media. This aligns with your interest in information-seeking processes related to consumption. You could draw parallels between the information search behaviors described in the paper and how consumers might seek information about the ethical and sustainable aspects of products or services.
* **Influence of Information Sources:** The paper examines the perceived value and trustworthiness of different social media sources for hotel information. This connects to your focus on information barriers and how accessible and transparent information can influence consumer choices. You could consider how the trustworthiness of information sources (e.g., company websites vs. independent reviews) might impact consumers' prioritization of responsible aspects.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Focus:** The reference paper's primary focus is on the hospitality industry and hotel decision-making. While there are overlaps with your research, the context is different. 
* **Sustainability/Ethics:** The paper doesn't explicitly address sustainability or ethical consumption. You would need to make connections and extrapolate from the findings on information seeking and social media influence.

While the reference paper focuses on ""health consciousness"" rather than ""socially and ethically responsible consumption,"" it does explore the relationship between consumer consciousness and information-seeking behavior. This aspect aligns with your interest in ""information seeking"" and how it influences responsible consumption.

Here's how you could potentially utilize this paper:

* **Comparative Insights:** You could draw comparisons between health-conscious consumers' information-seeking behaviors and those of consumers concerned with ethical consumption. Do similar patterns emerge? Are there notable differences in the types of information sought or the sources consulted?
* **Expanding the Scope:** The paper's findings on the disconnect between information seeking and actual purchase behavior could be relevant to your discussion of the ""intention-behavior gap.""

So far, carbon labelling has predominantly been discussed without taking into account German consumers’ opinions (proven by empirical data) on this issue, even though involving the consumer in the considerations of a Carbon Label is essential for its success. Especially the question, if information on the product carbon footprint is a considerable factor within the search process of a purchase decision, was of special interest in this work. To answer these questions, we analysed consumers’ information-seeking behaviour using an information display matrix (IDM) experiment with 232 participants. The IDM is a process tracing technique which allows to track the information search in a buying process. Our results show that basically the place of origin is the most important criterion for the purchase decision, followed by price and production method (conventional/organic). In contrast, the sustainability information (i.e., carbon footprint and water consumption) are at a low level of importance. Comparing two locally produced products with the help of a multinominal logistic regression-model, it seems that the group of consumers preferring organic products is influenced in the purchase decision by the carbon footprint information. In summary it can be stated that although some people may be basically interested in carbon labelling of fresh food, the purchase decision would probably be hardly influenced by a carbon label on vegetables at present. The majority of people are more concerned about factors like origin and price so that Carbon Labelling would only be a viable option for a small group of consumers. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",carbon footprint; consumer behavior; sustainable consumption,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020420113,Possibly,"Information seeking, Sustainability","
While the reference paper focuses on carbon labeling and its influence on vegetable purchasing decisions, it offers some potentially useful insights for your research:

* **Information Seeking Behavior:** The study utilizes an Information Display Matrix (IDM) experiment to track consumer information search during a buying process. This methodology could be valuable to consider for your own research, especially if you're interested in empirically examining how consumers seek information related to ethical consumption.
* **Limited Impact of Sustainability Information:** The findings suggest that carbon footprint information, while potentially relevant to some consumers, is not a primary driver of purchase decisions for most. This aligns with your paper's focus on information barriers and the ""intention-behavior gap."" You could cite this study to support your argument that accessible and transparent information is crucial for prioritizing responsible aspects, even among consumers with low initial ethical intentions.
* **Contextual Relevance:** Although the study focuses on carbon labeling, the broader context of sustainable consumption is relevant. You can draw parallels between the challenges of communicating carbon footprint information and the broader issue of making information about ethical aspects of products easily accessible and understandable to consumers.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Specificity:** The reference paper is quite specific to carbon labeling on vegetables. While relevant, its findings may not be directly generalizable to all aspects of socially and ethically responsible consumption.
* **Geographic Context:** The study was conducted in Germany, so cultural and contextual factors may influence the results. Consider whether these findings are transferable to your target audience. 


Overall, the reference paper offers some potentially useful insights into information seeking behavior and the limited impact of sustainability information on purchasing decisions. However, its specificity and geographic context warrant careful consideration when applying its findings to your broader research on responsible consumption."

While the reference paper focuses on ethical decision-making in an organizational context, rather than consumer behavior, it offers valuable insights into information-seeking preferences when ethical considerations are involved.  

Here's how you could potentially utilize it:

* **Comparative Analysis:** You could compare and contrast the information-seeking preferences of organizational decision-makers (as described in the reference paper) with those of consumers making ethical consumption choices. This could highlight similarities or differences in how individuals approach information gathering in ethically charged situations.
* **Theoretical Framework:** The reference paper's findings on preference for personal and internal sources of information could inform your own analysis of information barriers faced by consumers. It suggests that consumers might rely heavily on trusted sources (friends, family, communities) or information provided by brands, potentially overlooking more objective or comprehensive sources.
* **Limitations Discussion:** You could use the reference paper to acknowledge the limitations of your own study. Since your focus is on consumers, the findings from the reference paper, which centers on organizational decision-makers, may not be directly transferable. However, it can serve as a point of comparison and highlight the need for further research on information-seeking behaviors in the context of responsible consumption. 


Remember, the relevance is ""possibly"" because the contexts differ. However, the paper offers a valuable lens through which to examine information-seeking in ethical decision-making, which can enrich your own research."

While the reference paper focuses on general consumer information search behavior online, it could be useful in providing context for your study.  

Here's how:

* **Establishing a baseline:** The paper's findings on the increasing prevalence of online information seeking for major financial decisions could be used to highlight the growing importance of online information for consumers in general. You could then argue that this trend extends to responsible consumption decisions, even if the paper itself doesn't directly address sustainability.
* **Supporting your argument on information barriers:** The paper mentions that despite increased information sources, most consumers are not confused. This could be contrasted with your argument that information barriers still exist for responsible consumption, suggesting a need for more targeted and accessible information.
* **Identifying potential limitations:** The paper's focus on financial decisions might highlight a limitation in your own study. You could acknowledge that your findings may not be generalizable to all types of consumption decisions, and further research is needed to explore the role of information seeking in other contexts. 


**Important Note:** The reference paper's lack of focus on sustainability or ethical consumption means its relevance is limited. It should be used cautiously and primarily as supporting evidence rather than a core source for your arguments."

With the total population of 79,300 and an estimated annual population growth of 2.7% the Tweed Shire is one of the fastest growing local government areas along the NSW Coast. The land use patterns range from high-density urban and residential along the coast to low density rural and bushland in the upper reaches of the catchment. Rapid growth places the area under increasing pressure from development, which, in turn, adds to other already strong environmental pressures. The ability to assess nutrient emissions from the existing diffuse sources and those resulting from land use change is essential for planners to design environmentally sustainable development and for managers to focus limited resources to mitigate existing or potential inputs. The Tweed catchment was used as a pilot area to road test the assessment tools and the planning mechanisms developed within the NSW Comprehensive Coastal Assessment framework (CCA). A fused satellite imagery classification method was used to document spatio-temporal changes in land cover and land use that have occurred in the catchment since 1982. The results show that urban change has affected approximately 1400 hectares in total, with the coastal fringes of the catchment experiencing the strongest growth, where urban areas increased by 6.5% over the study period. If the current trends persist, 31 to 36% of the area might be under development by the year 2010 (Figure 1). The paper discusses changes in urbanization in the coastal areas of the Tweed Shire and the environmental impact of urban growth. The Long-Term Hydrologic Impact Assessment (L-THIA) model was used to predict changes in runoff and Non-Point Source (NPS) pollution from historical, current and proposed land uses in the catchment. The runoff volumes are predicted with the Curve Number (CN) method, which requires precipitation, soil type, vegetation cover, and management practice data. L-THIA requires land use classes from integrated image interpretation to estimate catchment emissions of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). Modelling results provide a vital insight into the relative hydrologic impacts of different land uses and land use change over time. The assessment of over 20 hypothetical land use change scenarios shows that urban development can make a major contribution to nutrient exports, and emphasizes the need for best management practices in urban design. Results also highlight that overall nutrient emission may be minimized by preferentially accommodating urban development within areas where current land uses are associated with high nutrient export rates. The assessment of nutrient loads and their impact on receiving waters can be used to raise community awareness of long-term pollution hazards and to support sustainable planning strategies. The use of GIS framework for testing of various urbanization options provides a means of deriving spatially distributed estimates and offers a platform for interpreting and synthesizing data from different sources.

While the reference paper focuses on online consumer decision-making in general, it touches upon factors that *could* be relevant to your research on information-seeking and responsible consumption.  

Here's how you might potentially utilize it:

* **Broad Context:** The reference paper provides a general framework for understanding online consumer decision-making. You could cite it to briefly establish the broader context within which your study on information-seeking and responsible consumption takes place.
* **Identifying Relevant Factors:** The paper mentions factors like ""marketing efforts,"" ""socio-cultural influences,"" and ""psychological factors"" that influence online purchasing. You could analyze whether and how these factors might intersect with information-seeking behaviors related to responsible consumption. For example, do certain marketing efforts mislead consumers about the ethical aspects of products?

**Important Considerations:**

* **Limited Focus:** The reference paper doesn't directly address sustainability or responsible consumption. Therefore, its relevance is indirect and requires careful interpretation within the context of your study.
* **Outdated Information:**  Given the rapid evolution of online shopping and consumer behavior, it's crucial to assess whether the insights from this paper (published without a year) are still current and applicable.

While the reference paper doesn't directly address sustainable or responsible consumption, it focuses on providing consumers with a representative subset of online reviews. This relates to the ""information availability"" aspect of your research.  

Here's how you could potentially utilize this paper:

* **Supporting Argument:** You could cite this paper to support your argument that information barriers exist in the context of responsible consumption. The sheer volume of online information can be overwhelming, making it difficult for consumers to find relevant and trustworthy information about ethical aspects of products. This paper demonstrates a method for addressing this information overload.
* **Discussing Solutions:** You could briefly discuss the ""RewSel"" approach as a potential solution to improve information accessibility for consumers interested in responsible consumption. While the paper doesn't focus on sustainability, the methodology could be adapted or expanded upon to curate reviews specifically related to ethical considerations.
* **Highlighting Limitations:** You could use this paper to highlight the limitations of relying solely on online reviews for information about responsible consumption. Even a representative subset might not capture the full complexity of ethical issues surrounding a product. This could strengthen your argument for the need for more comprehensive and transparent information systems.

This paper directly addresses **information seeking** behaviors related to responsible consumption (Fairtrade coffee in this case). While the specific focus is on Fairtrade coffee, the methodologies and findings can be insightful for your broader research on information-seeking processes and their influence on socially and ethically responsible consumption. 

Here's how you could utilize this paper:

* **Methodological Insights:** The paper uses the Information Display Matrix (IDM) method to understand consumer information needs. You could explore adapting this method or drawing comparisons to your own research design.
* **Consumer Behavior Parallels:**  The paper highlights how consumers prioritize product package information and prefer general information over specific details. This aligns with your interest in information barriers and how accessible information influences decision-making. You could discuss whether similar patterns emerge in your study across different ethical consumption contexts.
* **Supporting Evidence:** The finding that purchase decisions are more strongly related to search behavior than socio-demographic variables supports your argument about the critical role of information-seeking processes. You could cite this paper as evidence for this claim.
* **Contextualization:** While your research is broader than Fairtrade coffee, this paper provides a concrete example of how information seeking shapes responsible consumption choices. You could use it to illustrate the practical implications of your theoretical framework.

Drawing on basic models and concepts from consumer behaviour literature, we present the findings along the lines of five phases of the consumer decision-making process: (i) need recognition; (ii) information search; (iii) information evaluation; (iv) purchase decision; and (v) post-purchase evaluation. Consumer decision-making about animal-based food products is routine, situational and sometimes irrational, instead of based on complete information. Consumers associate animal welfare with a higher quality perception and labels and high prices further increase the perception of quality. The findings have implications for stakeholders that aim to develop a market for animal-friendly products, like (coalitions of) governments, animal interest groups, retailers and brand manufacturers. © 2011 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare The Old School.",Animal welfare; Animal-friendly brands; Animal-friendly products; Consumer concerns; Consumer decision-making; Marketing,Animalia; animal food; animal welfare; consumer; consumer attitude; decision making; government; human; market; quality control; review,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79551719114,Yes,"Availability, Seeking","
This paper, while focused on animal-friendly products, is relevant to your research in a few key ways:

* **Information Seeking:** The paper directly addresses the ""information search"" phase of the consumer decision-making process. It discusses how consumers seek information about animal welfare and how this influences their choices. This aligns with your interest in information-seeking processes and their impact on responsible consumption. You could cite this paper to support your argument about the importance of search behaviors in shaping ethical consumption.
* **Information Availability:** The paper highlights that consumer decision-making about animal-based products is often not based on complete information. This suggests the presence of information barriers, which directly relates to your focus on ""information barriers"" and their influence on the valuation of ethical aspects. You could use this paper to illustrate the concept of information barriers in a specific context (animal welfare) and draw parallels to other areas of responsible consumption.

**Additional Points:**

* While the paper focuses on animal welfare, the underlying principles of information seeking, availability, and their impact on ethical decision-making are transferable to other domains of responsible consumption.
* You could potentially use this paper as a springboard to explore how information about animal welfare is presented and whether there are instances of ""greenwashing"" or misleading information, which would tie into the ""asymmetries"" category.

Regarding the methodological aspects, the survey was a survey, in a self-administered questionnaire format for data collection, obtaining a total of 103 observations. The approach was quantitative in nature, the sample investigated was non-probabilistic and accessibility. The criterion adopted to participate in the research was to be a student of higher education. In the analysis was applied the Structural Equation Modeling. The results show that greenwashing is positively related to green consumer confusion, which in turn maintains a negative relationship with green trust. Also, there was a marginally significant level of correlation between greenwashing constructs and perceived risk. Thus, in the investigated audience, only green confusion acts as a mediator of the relationship between greenwashing and green trust.

While the reference paper focuses on greenwashing and its impact on consumer trust, it touches upon a relevant aspect for your research: **information asymmetries**. Greenwashing practices create an imbalance of information between companies and consumers. Companies may present misleading or exaggerated environmental claims, making it difficult for consumers to accurately assess the sustainability of products or services.

Here's how you could potentially utilize this paper:

* **Supporting your argument:** The paper provides evidence of how information asymmetries, specifically through greenwashing, can hinder responsible consumption. You can cite this study to strengthen your argument about the importance of addressing information barriers.
* **Expanding on the concept of barriers:** While your focus is on information access and transparency, the reference paper highlights another type of barrier – deceptive information. This can add nuance to your discussion of the challenges consumers face in making responsible choices.
* **Contextualizing your findings:** If your research finds that accessible information leads to prioritization of ethical aspects, you can contrast this with the findings of the reference paper, showing how transparent information can counteract the negative effects of greenwashing. 


**Important Note:** The reference paper's primary focus is not on information seeking or availability in the same way your research is. Therefore, its relevance is indirect and should be used judiciously to support specific points rather than as a core source for your arguments."

While the reference paper doesn't directly focus on sustainable or responsible consumption, it does delve into the impact of information-seeking tools (shopbots) on consumer behavior. This aspect is relevant to your research in the following ways:

* **Supporting your argument:** The paper's findings that shopbots can significantly alter information-search behavior align with your focus on how information-seeking processes influence responsible consumption. You can cite this paper to support your claim that access to information (in this case, facilitated by shopbots) can shape consumer decisions.
* **Drawing parallels:** Although the study focuses on financial services, you can draw parallels between the use of shopbots and the potential for information systems or decision-support tools tailored to promote responsible consumption. The paper's discussion on consumer perceptions of shopbots as value-added services could be relevant when considering how to design user-friendly tools for ethical consumption.
* **Highlighting limitations:** The paper's finding of only partial support for changes in choice behavior, despite significant changes in information-seeking, could be a valuable point to consider. It suggests that simply providing information might not be enough to guarantee responsible choices and highlights the need for further research on how to effectively translate information into action. 


**Important Note:**  

While the reference paper offers some potentially useful insights, it's crucial to emphasize the differences in context. Your research focuses specifically on sustainable and ethical consumption, a domain not directly addressed in the reference paper.

While the reference paper focuses on healthcare decisions rather than sustainable/responsible consumption, it offers valuable insights into how anecdotal information influences choices.  

Here's how you could potentially utilize it:

* **Analogous Reasoning:** You could draw parallels between the influence of anecdotal information on healthcare choices and its potential impact on responsible consumption decisions. For example, you could discuss how online reviews, testimonials, or social media posts about ethical brands might act as ""anecdotal information"" swaying consumer choices, even if they contradict more factual data about a product's sustainability.
* **Information Processing:** The study's finding that initial anecdotal information acts as an ""anchor point"" is particularly relevant. You could explore whether similar anchoring effects occur in responsible consumption contexts. Do consumers rely heavily on initial impressions or stories they encounter, even if they later receive more comprehensive information about a product's ethical implications?
* **Information Barriers:** The paper highlights the challenges consumers face in understanding complex public reports. You could connect this to the information barriers consumers encounter when trying to assess the sustainability or ethicality of products. This could support your argument for the need for improved information systems and decision-support tools.

Studies bring to fore difficulties of choosing sustainable alternatives in a complex world. How are consumers to know what products to purchase in a market society with global commodity chains? Can consumers really trust corporations' environmental reporting? In arguing this, these studies are giving voice to some of the difficulties and anxieties people have to deal with in a consumer society. As others have argued, consumption involves work and being a consumer is increasingly a laborious and anxiety-producing activity. However, what these studies are missing is the fact that consumers do manage to consume green, at least some of them do. An interesting question is then, how is this complexity managed? The aim of this paper is to contribute to the field of green consumption by illustrating and conceptualizing how consumers practically manage green complexities when performing green shopping. The focus is on shopping practices. Drawing on an ethnographic study of the Nordic Nature Shop - a Swedish retailer chain of outdoor products - and making use of practice theory, this paper shows that consumers have different strategies and techniques to make their shopping practices more sustainable. One strategy used is to shop for things that last. Consumers focused then on finding quality outdoor products with 'timeless design'. Another strategy included instead consuming less. These consumers had different techniques that aimed at reducing their overall consumption of outdoors products. Finally, there were also those that focused on purchasing green products. Here, two techniques were talked about. While some focused on finding green brands, others looked at the product information in search on information concerning its manufacturing. In sum, the practice-based analysis showed that green complexities are managed through the development of various green shopping strategies. Green shopping, however, is not an uncomplicated accomplishment.

* **Contextualizing Information Seeking:** The paper highlights different shopping orientations (e.g., catalog/internet, mall shopping) and how they influence channel preferences. This could be used to contextualize the *types* of information seeking behaviors consumers engage in when pursuing responsible consumption. For example, are consumers with a strong catalog/internet orientation more likely to seek out information about ethical sourcing online?
* **Channel-Specific Barriers:** The paper discusses satisfaction with information search across different channels. This could spark ideas for your research on information barriers. Are there specific channels where information about responsible consumption is harder to find or less transparent?

**Important Considerations:**

* **Limited Focus on Ethics:** The reference paper doesn't directly address sustainable or responsible consumption. Its value lies in providing insights into consumer behavior and channel preferences that *could* be indirectly related to your topic.
* **Need for Further Exploration:** To make this reference paper truly useful, you'd need to conduct further research to connect the shopping orientations and channel preferences discussed to the specific context of responsible consumption.

Because a number of important differences exist in the marketing/consumer behavior process for goods versus services, there is a need for study of the prepurchase information search for services, particularly professional services. Medical, legal, dental, and veterinary services are often selected shortly after relocation to a new geographical area. Therefore, this research examined prepurchase information search as part of the experience of new residents who need to rebuild their transactional relationships. More than two hundred new residents participated in the research by returning a questionnaire dealing with their use of various information sources prior to choosing a professional service. Among other findings, the study confirmed the importance of personal sources of information in the search process and showed that new residents are generally satisfied with their new professional service providers. Different patterns of search, however, were followed in the search process. © 1989 MCB UP Ltd",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038473164,Possibly,Information seeking,"
While the reference paper focuses on pre-purchase information seeking for professional services, it offers some potentially valuable insights for your research on information-seeking processes and responsible consumption. 

Here's how you could potentially utilize it:

* **Comparative Analysis:** You could compare and contrast the information-seeking behaviors described in the reference paper with those of consumers seeking information about ethically responsible products or services. This could highlight similarities and differences in the types of information sources used, the perceived trustworthiness of those sources, and the influence of social networks.
* **Conceptual Framework:** The paper's discussion of different patterns of search could inform the development of a conceptual framework for understanding how consumers navigate information related to responsible consumption.  
* **Methodological Insights:** The reference paper's use of a questionnaire to gather data on information-seeking behaviors could provide methodological inspiration for your own research.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Contextual Differences:** It's crucial to acknowledge the significant contextual differences between seeking information about professional services and seeking information about ethically responsible products. The stakes, emotional involvement, and complexity of the decision-making process may vary considerably.
* **Limited Scope:** The reference paper does not directly address sustainability or responsible consumption. Therefore, its relevance is limited to providing insights into general information-seeking behaviors.

However, when confronted with 'ethical' products, consumers often become more involved, and this results in a more extensive search for information. This research focuses on the information search behaviour of European consumers with regard to ethical attributes like animal welfare or environmental aspects of organic food by means of an Information Display Matrix. Row-wise information search by product characteristics (attributes) was widely preferred over information search by product alternatives (column-wise). Therefore, information (e.g. in the Internet) should increasingly be provided by attributes. The majority of consumers use simplifying and selective search strategies when looking for information on organic food with additional ethical attributes. Consumers tend to start information search in the top, left hand corner and move towards the bottom, right hand corner. Thus, principal attributes should be placed in the upper left corner and be followed by the next most important and so on when presenting information on an array of different products. Our results show that information search patterns of consumers depend on socio-demographic characteristics like gender and age and, to a lesser extent, also on attitudes regarding environmental or social aspects of food production. Thus, marketers, particularly those using the Internet, should revise their systems of information provision and focus increasingly on consumers' needs. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Consumer behaviour; Decision heuristics; Ethical consumerism; Internet marketing.,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867356896,Yes,Seeking,"
This paper directly relates to your research on information-seeking processes and responsible consumption. While it focuses on organic food, the core findings about consumer information search behavior are transferable to your broader context. Here's how you can utilize it:

* **Support for your argument:** The reference paper provides empirical evidence that consumers engage in more extensive information search when faced with ethical product attributes. This supports your argument about the importance of search behaviors in shaping responsible consumption.
* **Insights into search patterns:** The study's findings on search patterns (row-wise by attributes, starting from the top left corner) can inform your discussion on how information is accessed and processed by consumers considering ethical aspects.
* **Highlighting the need for tailored information:** The paper emphasizes the need for information providers (like marketers and policymakers) to structure information in a way that aligns with consumer search patterns. This aligns with your call for improved information systems and decision-support tools.

**Additional Points:**

* You can contrast the reference paper's focus on organic food with your broader scope of ""socially and ethically responsible consumption."" This can help you highlight the generalizability of your findings.
* Consider discussing the limitations of the reference paper's methodology (e.g., reliance on an Information Display Matrix) and how your research addresses these limitations.

In contrast to computer ethics, machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines toward human users and other machines. This study aims to use an action-based ethical theory founded on the combinational aspects of deontological and teleological theories of ethics in the construction of an artificial moral agent (AMA). Design/methodology/approach: The decision results derived by the AMA are acquired via fuzzy logic interpretation of the relative values of the steady-state simulations of the corresponding rule-based fuzzy cognitive map (RBFCM). Findings: Through the use of RBFCMs, the following paper illustrates the possibility of incorporating ethical components into machines, where latent semantic analysis (LSA) and RBFCMs can be used to model dynamic and complex situations, and to provide abilities in acquiring causal knowledge. Research limitations/implications: This approach is especially appropriate for data-poor and uncertain situations common in ethics. Nonetheless, to ensure that a machine with an ethical component can function autonomously in the world, research in artificial intelligence will need to further investigate the representation and determination of ethical principles, the incorporation of these ethical principles into a system’s decision procedure, ethical decision-making with incomplete and uncertain knowledge, the explanation for decisions made using ethical principles and the evaluation of systems that act based upon ethical principles. Practical implications: To date, the conducted research has contributed to a theoretical foundation for machine ethics through exploration of the rationale and the feasibility of adding an ethical dimension to machines. Further, the constructed AMA illustrates the possibility of utilizing an action-based ethical theory that provides guidance in ethical decision-making according to the precepts of its respective duties. The use of LSA illustrates their powerful capabilities in understanding text and their potential application as information retrieval systems in AMAs. The use of cognitive maps provides an approach and a decision procedure for resolving conflicts between different duties. Originality/value: This paper suggests that cognitive maps could be used in AMAs as tools for meta-analysis, where comparisons regarding multiple ethical principles and duties can be examined and considered. With cognitive mapping, complex and abstract variables that cannot easily be measured but are important to decision-making can be modeled. This approach is especially appropriate for data-poor and uncertain situations common in ethics. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Decision making and ethics; Natural language processing in machine ethics; Rule based fuzzy cognitive maps,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982986550,Possibly,Other,"
While the reference paper focuses on machine ethics and building artificial moral agents (AMAs), it touches upon concepts relevant to your research in a tangential way. 

Here's how it could be potentially utilized:

* **Information Access and Ethical Decision-Making:** The paper discusses how AMAs can be designed to make ethical decisions by accessing and processing information. This aligns with your interest in how information availability influences responsible consumption. You could draw a parallel between the AMA's need for ethical information and consumers' need for transparent and accessible information about product sustainability and ethical practices.
* **Modeling Complex Ethical Considerations:** The paper highlights the use of fuzzy cognitive maps and latent semantic analysis (LSA) to model complex ethical situations. This could inspire you to explore similar methodologies for understanding the multifaceted factors influencing consumers' ethical decision-making processes related to consumption.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Direct Applicability:** The reference paper is not directly focused on sustainable or responsible consumption. Its application to your research would require drawing connections and extrapolating concepts from the context of machine ethics to human consumer behavior.
* **Focus Shift:**  Be cautious about overemphasizing the connection. Your primary focus should remain on information-seeking processes and their impact on responsible consumption, not on building ethical AI.

While the reference paper focuses on a ""green product"" search engine, it touches upon elements relevant to your research in a couple of ways:

* **Information Availability:** The paper explicitly addresses the challenge of making green product information accessible to consumers. This aligns with your interest in how information barriers influence responsible consumption. You could cite this paper as an example of a system attempting to address this barrier, even if its specific focus is on a search engine rather than broader information-seeking processes.

Findings: It was possible to evaluate a model that analyzed the aspects that greenwashing carries and the aspects that the attitudes and beliefs of the consumer present. As a result, it is inferred that when greenwashing is identified in the product, it loses the aspects of loyalty, satisfaction and benefits, as well as becoming a product that causes confusion of consumption. Further, consumer attitudes and beliefs show that they are guided by the aspects of perceived loyalty, satisfaction and benefits and that the perceived risk aspect is practically ignored.

With terminal patients increasingly seeking and sharing health information and support via social media, it is timely to examine whether these trajectories are reflected in their digital narratives. In this exploratory study, we analysed the Twitter feed of prominent cancer sufferer and physician, Kate Granger, over the final 6 months of her life. Methods: With the consent of Kate's widower, Chris Pointon, 1628 Twitter posts from @GrangerKate were manually screened. The 550 tweets judged relevant to her disease were qualitatively content analysed with reference to the six modifiable dimensions of the patient experience in Emanuel and Emanuel's 'framework for a good death'. The frequency of each tweet category was charted over time and textual content was examined and cross-referenced with key events, to obtain a deeper understanding of its nature and significance. Results: Tweets were associated with physical symptoms (N = 270), psychological and cognitive symptoms (N = 213), social relationships and support (N = 85), economic demands and care giving needs (N = 85), hopes and expectations (N = 51) and spiritual beliefs (N = 7). While medical treatments and procedures were discussed in detail, medical information-seeking was largely absent, likely reflecting Kate clinical expertise. Spirituality was expressed more as hope in treatments or ""someone out there listening"", than in religious terms. The high value of Kate's palliative care team was a dominant theme in the support category, alongside the support she received from her online community of fellow sufferers, friends, family and colleagues. Significant events, such as medical procedures and hospital stays generated the densest Twitter engagement. Transitions between trajectory phases were marked by changes in the relative frequency of tweet-types. Conclusions: In Kate's words, ""the power of patient narrative cannot be underestimated"". While this analysis spanned only 6 months, it yielded rich insights. The results reflect theorised end-of-life dimensions and reveal the potential of social media data and digital bio-ethnography to shine a light on terminal patients' lived experiences, coping strategies and support needs, suggesting new opportunities for enhancing personalised palliative care and avenues for further research. © 2018 The Author(s).","Cancer; End-of-life care, Death and dying, Social media; Netnography; Palliative care; Patient experience, Illness trajectories, Digital ethnography; Twitter",Humans; Neoplasms; Qualitative Research; Social Media; Spirituality; Terminal Care; Terminally Ill; Article; cancer patient; controlled study; ethical decision making; expectation; hope; human; information seeking; informed consent; palliative therapy; qualitative research; religion; social interaction; social support; terminal care; complication; neoplasm; psychology; social media; terminal care; terminally ill patient; utilization,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040943545,Possibly,Other,"
Here's how it could be potentially useful:

* **Highlighting Contextual Differences:** The paper demonstrates how information seeking behaviors can vary drastically depending on the context.  While your research focuses on responsible consumption, understanding how individuals with a terminal illness seek and utilize information online could provide insights into the emotional and psychological factors influencing information processing. This could help you nuance your understanding of how consumers approach information related to ethical consumption.
* **Exploring the Role of Online Communities:** The study highlights the importance of online communities in providing support and information. This could be relevant to your research if you're exploring how consumers learn about and discuss responsible consumption practices online. 
* **Qualitative Insights:** The qualitative analysis of tweets offers a rich source of data on how individuals express their needs and concerns. While the focus is on end-of-life care, the methodologies used in the study (content analysis, thematic analysis) could be adapted to analyze consumer discussions about ethical consumption online.

This paper outlines the design and development of a prototype web-GIS Decision Support System (DSS), CRP-DSS, for use in resource management and assessment of environmental quality. Specifically, the DSS is targeted toward aiding USDA to better manage and plan CRP enrollments. The DSS is based on the emerging industry-standard ArcIMS GIS platform and integrates a mapping component AFIRS (Automated Feature Information Retrieval System) and a modeling component SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool). Our novel integrated web-GIS DSS is implemented using web server and Java Servlet technology over an ArcIMS platform to support data access and processing in a distributed environment. AFIRS functions as a feature extraction protocol that uses multisource geospatial data sets and SWAT serves to simulate long-term trends of soil and water quality. The prototype DSS was applied to simulate the sediment and nutrient dynamics of a small watershed in the Oklahoma Panhandle. We intend to develop the prototype CRP-DSS into a full-fledged tool geared to enable USDA better manage and plan future CRP enrollments. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This article deviates from the purchasing perspective and instead proposes an information and web-based communication message ‘seeking and consumption1 perspective. This new perspective is theoretically grounded in two new approaches to online consumer behaviour: the web-based communication exposure and internal psychological behavioural processes approaches; as well as the integration of various theoretical perspectives, approaches, theories and models that address fragments of offline and online consumer behaviour. The research problem is to address the existing limited and fragmented approaches, because existing purchasing perspectives arguably do not provide adequate theoretical criteria to explain online consumer behaviour during interactive information-seeking and consumption activities. Hence, the main aim of this article is to propose new theoretical criteria for online consumer behaviour to address these shortcomings. © 2016 Unisa Press.",consumer decision making; consumer information processing and response; determinants of consumer behaviour; information consumption; internal psychological behavioural processes; online consumer behaviour; web-based communication exposure,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961282323,Possibly,Information seeking,"
While the reference paper doesn't directly focus on sustainable or responsible consumption, it offers a theoretical framework for understanding online information-seeking behavior. This could be valuable to your research in the following ways:

* **Broadening your theoretical foundation:** The paper proposes two new approaches to online consumer behavior – web-based communication exposure and internal psychological behavioral processes. Incorporating these approaches could enrich your analysis of how consumers seek information related to responsible consumption.
* **Understanding information-seeking motivations:** The paper's focus on ""information and web-based communication message 'seeking and consumption'"" could provide insights into the motivations driving consumers to seek information about ethical aspects of products or services.
* **Identifying potential barriers:**  The paper highlights the limitations of existing purchasing perspectives in explaining online information-seeking behavior. This could prompt you to consider additional barriers to information access specific to responsible consumption, beyond those you've already identified.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Specificity:** The reference paper is quite broad in its scope. You'll need to carefully extract the elements most relevant to your specific research question on responsible consumption.
* **Application:**  You'll need to bridge the gap between the paper's general framework and the specific context of sustainable and ethical consumption. This will require thoughtful analysis and interpretation."

One impressive characteristic of the Internet is that it offers users various degrees of information control on the same medium. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of this characteristic on consumers' decision-making online. It is hypothesized that, to improve quality of consumers' decisions, the degree of information control should match the degree of motivation. The rationale is that highly motivated consumers have a strong will to search for relevant information; therefore, a high degree of information control allows them to search as much as they want and thereby improve their decision making. Low-motivation consumers, on the other hand, are unwilling to search; hence a low degree of information control, which might push high-quality information, would benefit them. The study employed the methodology of experiment, and involved 171 voluntary participants. The empirical results show that high-motivation consumers make better decisions when they are given a high degree of information control, compared to when they are in a low information control condition. On the other hand, low-motivation consumers in a low information control condition perform better than similar consumers in a high-control condition. The results strongly support the match hypothesis of information control. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867476500,Possibly,Information seeking,"
While the reference paper doesn't directly focus on sustainable or responsible consumption, it offers valuable insights into the relationship between information control and consumer decision-making.  

Here's how you could potentially utilize it:

* **Supporting your argument on information barriers:** The paper demonstrates that the level of information control can significantly impact decision quality. This aligns with your argument that information barriers can hinder responsible consumption. You could cite this paper to support the idea that providing consumers with the right level of control over information related to ethical aspects of products can improve their decision-making.
* **Highlighting the importance of tailored information strategies:** The study's findings on the ""match hypothesis"" suggest that information strategies should be tailored to consumers' motivation levels. This could be relevant to your work by emphasizing the need for diverse approaches to information provision, catering to consumers with varying levels of initial ethical concern.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Contextual Differences:** Remember that the reference paper focuses on general online decision-making, not specifically on ethical consumption. You'll need to carefully contextualize its findings within your research on responsible consumption.
* **Limited Scope:** The paper doesn't address the specific information barriers related to sustainability or ethical considerations. You'll still need to rely on other sources to directly support those aspects of your argument. 


Overall, the reference paper offers some potentially useful insights into the broader topic of information seeking and decision-making, which can indirectly support your arguments about the role of information in shaping responsible consumption."

While the reference paper focuses on building consumer trust and satisfaction through sustainable business practices in the context of organic supermarkets, it touches upon elements relevant to your research:

* **Sustainability:** The paper clearly aligns with the theme of sustainable consumption, which is central to your work. You could cite it to provide context on the growing consumer interest in sustainable products and the challenges associated with trust and information.
* **Possible Availability:** The paper mentions that sustainable consumption has increased consumer decision-making complexity. This indirectly relates to the availability of information. Consumers may struggle to find reliable and transparent information about the sustainability of products, leading to decision-making difficulties. You could potentially use this point to support your argument about the need for improved information systems.

**Limitations:**

* The paper doesn't directly address information-seeking processes or information barriers as your research does. 
* Its focus is on building trust through sustainable business practices rather than on the influence of information availability on consumer behavior.

In this context, companies commit themselves to advancing good social, environmental, and animal-welfare practices in their business operations, including sustainable sourcing practices. Nevertheless, even if many companies in the global beauty care industry have embraced such claims, common practices such as water pollution, the use of pesticides in the production of fibers, poor labor conditions, and animal testing are omnipresent. According to the European Commission, 11.5 million animals were used in the European Union for experimental or scientific purposes in 2011. Worldwide this figure rises to 115 million animals annually (Four Paws International2013). In the rising tension between “greenwashing” and the use of ethical/environmental commitments that are nothing more than “sheer lip service,” the question arises of the role of the consumers with regard to sustainable practices in the cosmetics industry. Are consumers increasingly conscious of the adverse effects of ethical and environmental imbalances? And what effect does this knowledge have on their buying behavior? On the divergent poles of hypocrisy and true commitment, to advance current understanding of sustainability and related links to consumer perception and actual buying behavior related to ethical issues, the aim of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive framework of animal welfare in the personal care industry. Based on existing theoretical and empirical insights it becomes evident that psychological determinants, such as personality traits, empathy, ethical obligation, and self-identity, as well as context-related determinants in terms of one’s ethical value perception of products, the trade-off between ethical and conventional products, and an individual’s involvement, represent antecedents of ethical consumer behavior, which can be expressed through the avoidance of specific products and brands and/or consumer boycott and buycott towards cosmetics using animal-tested ingredients.

However, their authenticity and quality has proven hard to control, especially as polluters target these reviews toward promoting products or in degrading competitors. In a troubling direction, the widespread growth of crowdsourcing platforms like Mechanical Turk has created a large-scale, potentially difficult-to-detect workforce of malicious review writers. Hence, this paper tackles the challenge of uncovering crowdsourced manipulation of online reviews through a three-part effort: (i) First, we propose a novel sampling method for identifying products that have been targeted for manipulation and a seed set of deceptive reviewers who have been enlisted through crowdsourcing platforms. (ii) Second, we augment this base set of deceptive reviewers through a reviewer-reviewer graph clustering approach based on a Markov Random Field where we define individual potentials (of single reviewers) and pair potentials (between two reviewers). (iii) Finally, we embed the results of this probabilistic model into a classification framework for detecting crowd-manipulated reviews.

While the reference paper focuses on detecting manipulated online reviews, it touches upon a relevant concept for your research: **information asymmetries**.  

* **Connecting the Dots:** Your paper examines how information barriers can hinder responsible consumption. The reference paper highlights how malicious actors can manipulate information (online reviews) to create a false impression of a product's ethical standing. This manipulation exemplifies an information asymmetry where consumers lack access to accurate and unbiased information, potentially leading them to make less responsible choices.

* **Potential Applications:**

    * **Supporting Argument:** You could cite this paper to strengthen your argument about the existence and impact of information asymmetries in the context of responsible consumption.
    * **Expanding Scope:** You might briefly discuss the issue of manipulated online reviews as an example of a specific type of information barrier consumers face.
    * **Future Research:** The reference paper could inspire further research into how to mitigate the effects of manipulated information on responsible consumption decisions.

While the reference paper doesn't directly focus on information-seeking processes, it highlights a crucial aspect related to your research: **information asymmetries and their impact on consumer perception**. 

The ""negative footprint illusion"" demonstrates how consumers can be misled by the presence of a ""green"" element, leading them to underestimate the overall environmental impact. This finding directly connects to your interest in information barriers and how they shape the valuation of ethical aspects.

Here's how you can utilize this paper:

* **Support your argument:** The reference paper provides empirical evidence of how information asymmetry, potentially driven by greenwashing practices, can distort consumer understanding of sustainability. This supports your argument about the need for improved information systems and decision-support tools.
* **Expand on information barriers:** You can draw upon the ""negative footprint illusion"" as an example of a specific information barrier that consumers face. This adds depth to your discussion of information challenges in responsible consumption.
* **Highlight the importance of transparency:** The paper implicitly emphasizes the importance of transparent and accurate information. You can use this to strengthen your call for improved information accessibility and clarity in promoting responsible consumption. 


By incorporating this reference, you can strengthen your argument by grounding it in empirical evidence of how information asymmetries can negatively influence consumer behavior."

Research supports that chronic pain is a multifaceted process and the concurrent interplay between pathophysiology, cognitive, affective, behavioral and sociocultural factors summate to what is referred to as the chronic pain experience. The adequate treatment of pain has been highlighted in recent years with emphasis on the need for a multidisciplinary approach. It has emerged that chronic pain is experienced differently among patients of differing cultures and ethnicities. Objectives: The objectives were to identify and critically appraise relevant research and give an integrated comprehensive overview of key considerations for the interaction of culture and chronic pain. Findings would potentially identify and stimulate areas for local research, while promoting awareness, multidisciplinary cooperation and policy development to inform decision-making and culturally relevant clinical practice. Methods: A collective review of local and international literature was conducted using a systematic approach. Articles from the last 20 years, across three major disciplines were identified by relevance to the research question and key words. A final total of 30 articles were retrieved, categorized, analyzed, and synthesized. Results: The reviewed data yielded a large number of potential outcomes to examine, ranging from patient variables, to limitations of healthcare providers to shortcomings of the healthcare system.

In this paper, we examine the impacts of environmental concerns, cost of clean production, cross price sensitivity (market competition effect) and production costs on the choice of clean technology and the two producers' pricing behaviours. The most important finding of the analysis demonstrates that environmental concerns play a vital important role in growing the market share of green products and encouraging the CP to upgrade the technology level of clean production. Furthermore, an increase in environmental concerns leads to rise up of price, sales volume and profit of not only green products but also the non-green counterparts.

The use of protest tactics among broader publics is also a significant legacy. However, the mainstreaming of green stakes and their co-option - 'green washing' - is causing clashes between 'strong green' and 'weak green' perspectives, particularly around issues of green consumption, power relations and political economy.

While there is mutual consent of extant research about certifications’ positive effects on labeled products, knowledge about potential side effects on uncertified products remains scarce. With regard to extensive costs that employing a quality label can entail, portfolio-related considerations should also be considered when deciding about a brand’s overall certification strategy. Therefore, we look beyond the straightforward positive effects of product certifications by focusing on how certifying merely selected products (i.e., a partial certification strategy) affects consumers’ perceptions of unlabeled products of the same brand (i.e., bystander products). Using a mixed methods approach, we offer new insights that reveal how consumers’ perceptions are affected in multiple ways. First, partial certification causes a direct negative reference effect on quality perceptions of the bystander, i.e., the reference frame used to assess alternatives is shifted upward due to the presence of a certified product, which impairs perceptions of non-certified products (Parducci, 1965). Second, quality perceptions of the bystander indirectly benefit from a partial certification strategy by enhanced perceptions of the certified target that spill over to the whole brand and its affiliated products (Simonin & Ruth, 1998). Third, consumers perceive it as inconsistent if brands certify only selected products of their assortment. This reduces the extent to which they know what to expect from the brand (Erdem & Swait, 1998) and raises skepticism toward its overall intentions (i.e., greenwashing motives). This negative inconsistency effect impairs quality perceptions’ of the bystander. Further, we demonstrate how these effects differ depending on the type of certification. If consumers think that a brand can actively influence which of its products are certified (e.g., in case of organic labels), the negative inconsistency effect is significant. However, for certifications that depend on external sources’ decisions (e.g., consumer test marks; Krischik, 1998), this inconsistency effect diminishes. Also, positive spillover effects are higher for consumer test labels compared to organic labels. These differences result in more negative total effects on consumer perceptions’ of bystander products for a partial certification strategy with organic labels versus consumer test marks. Our findings establish a differentiated understanding of underlying cognitive processes that can be used in future research to assess under which conditions’ positive effects can be enhanced and negative effects reduced in order to optimize a brand’s overall certification strategy. © 2018, Academy of Marketing Science.",Affiliate Production; Consumer Perceptions; Negative Total Effect; Organic Label; Product Certifications,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125245620,Possibly,"Asymmetries, Information Availability","
While the reference paper doesn't directly focus on information-seeking behaviors like your study, it touches upon relevant concepts that could be valuable to your research:

* **Information Asymmetries:** The paper highlights how partial certification strategies can create information asymmetries. Consumers may perceive inconsistencies when brands selectively certify products, leading to skepticism and potential ""greenwashing"" concerns. This aligns with your interest in information barriers and how they influence responsible consumption.

* **Information Availability and its Impact:** The study demonstrates how the availability (or lack thereof) of complete information about a brand's sustainability practices can shape consumer perceptions.  The findings on ""spillover effects"" and ""negative inconsistency effects"" suggest that incomplete information can negatively impact the perceived ethical value of uncertified products within a brand's portfolio.

**How to Utilize:**

1. **Support your arguments:** You can cite this paper to support your claims about the importance of transparent and comprehensive information for fostering responsible consumption. The study's findings on consumer skepticism towards partial certification strategies reinforce the need for accessible and reliable information.

2. **Expand your discussion:** The paper's insights on information asymmetries and consumer perceptions can enrich your discussion on information barriers. You could explore how selective information disclosure by brands might contribute to the ""intention-behavior gap"" you're investigating.

3. **Consider different certification types:** The paper's distinction between certifications based on brand control (e.g., organic labels) and those based on external assessments (e.g., consumer test marks) could be relevant to your analysis. You might consider exploring how different types of information sources influence consumer trust and decision-making in the context of responsible consumption. 



Remember, while this paper offers valuable insights, it's not a direct match for your research focus. Use it selectively to strengthen your arguments and broaden your discussion on information-related challenges in promoting responsible consumption."

An empirical study was conducted using a developed research model that hypothesized the effects of selected variables on information seeking behavior at social network online communities. The analyzed data were 186 samples collected from female college students who had more than three months of experience at a social network online community. The results confirmed the positive relationship between commitment to a social network online community and information seeking behavior at the community. This relationship was expected to be moderated by individuals' sensitivity to group conformity. A visual inspection of the plot suggested a meaningful implication, but no significant statistical results were identified in a following test. Results also found commitment will be developed when the individuals are psychologically attached to the community. Generalization of the results in a larger population is cautioned because the collected data represent specific demographics. Apparel retailers may want to utilize the results of this study to develop an online community representing the company brands. In order to increase members' psychological attachment and commitment to an online apparel brand community, key strategies should be focused on providing active and enjoyable interactions among the community members through unique/creative communication methods, fun experiences, and diverse off-line events.

While the reference paper doesn't directly address sustainable or responsible consumption, it delves into consumer search styles and the factors influencing pre-purchase search behavior. This could be valuable to your research in the following ways:

* **Understanding Search Behaviors:** The paper identifies three distinct shopper types based on their decision-making styles.  You could explore whether these shopper types exhibit different information-seeking behaviors related to ethical consumption. For example, do ""fashionable and self-discipline shoppers"" prioritize ethical information differently than ""pragmatic shoppers""?
* **Influencing Factors:** The paper highlights product attributes, web store evaluation, and special functions/promotions as key factors in pre-purchase search. You could investigate how these factors intersect with ethical considerations. Do consumers prioritize ethical information when evaluating product attributes or web store trustworthiness?
* **Informing Information Systems:** The reference paper mentions the development of a product recommendation system based on shopper styles. This could inspire ideas for designing information systems or decision-support tools that cater to the specific information needs of consumers interested in responsible consumption.

**Important Note:**

While the reference paper focuses on omni-channel retailing and consumer decision-making, it touches upon aspects relevant to your research, albeit indirectly. 

Here's how it could be potentially utilized:

* **Information Search Patterns:** The paper investigates information search patterns in omni-channel retail, including the depth and types of information sought. This could offer insights into how consumers gather information about products, potentially including information related to ethical and sustainable aspects. You could draw parallels between their findings and the information-seeking behaviors you're examining in your study.
* **Decision-Making Strategies:** The paper identifies decision-making strategies used by consumers in omni-channel contexts. Understanding these strategies could be helpful in contextualizing how information about responsible consumption influences consumer choices. For example, if consumers primarily rely on ""weighted additive rule"" (WADD), it suggests they weigh different product attributes, potentially including ethical considerations, in a systematic manner.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Limited Focus on Sustainability:** The reference paper doesn't explicitly address sustainable or responsible consumption. Its primary focus is on omni-channel retail experiences. Therefore, its relevance is indirect and requires careful interpretation.
* **Potential for Broader Application:** Despite the limited direct relevance, the paper's findings on information search and decision-making could provide a valuable framework for understanding consumer behavior in a broader context, which could then be applied to your research on responsible consumption.

In this transition, consumers' comprehension and engagement are necessary points to guide them towards more environmentally conscious purchases. This study extends the understanding of green consumer behaviour by testing an integrated conceptual model that explores the influence of personal concern, other pro-environmental behaviours, greenwashing beliefs, consumer innovativeness, and personal predisposition to seeking information on the purchasing of circular packaging. We explored both the stand-alone and the mediating effects of information seeking. Data were collected from a questionnaire-based survey administered to a large and representative sample of Italian families, using 1,643 valid responses. We used structural equation modelling to test the proposed hypotheses. The results highlight the fundamental importance of seeking information in order to guide consumption choices that are more consistent with the circular economy.

This paper is relevant to your research in two key ways:

1. **Information Seeking:** The reference paper directly investigates the role of information seeking in driving consumer choices towards circular packaging, a specific aspect of responsible consumption.  Their findings on the mediating effect of information seeking align with your focus on how search behaviors influence the valuation of ethical aspects during decision-making. You could cite this paper to support your argument that accessible information is crucial for promoting responsible consumption.

2. **Information Availability:** While not explicitly stated, the study implies a link between information availability and responsible consumption. By demonstrating that consumers actively seek information about circular packaging, the paper suggests that making such information readily available could encourage more sustainable purchasing decisions. This aligns with your interest in the influence of information barriers and the need for improved information systems.

You could use this paper to:

* **Strengthen your argument:**  Cite their findings to support your claim that accessible information drives prioritization of responsible aspects.
* **Provide empirical evidence:**  Their quantitative study using a large sample size adds weight to your argument.
* **Explore specific contexts:**  While your research is broader, their focus on circular packaging offers a concrete example of how information seeking impacts responsible consumption in a particular domain.

Understanding consumer information search behavior is vital for organizations in order to plan their communication strategy and reach consumers effectively. Though consumer information search behavior is extensively studied in traditional brick and mortar purchase situations, there is dearth of research in understanding consumer information search behavior in online shopping occasions. Given the rapid growth in electronic retail over the last few years, it is imperative to understand consumer information search behavior in online buying situations. This study investigates the factors that influence the extent of usage of different information sources in pre-purchase information search by online shoppers through an empirical research among 1079 online shoppers. The analysis of data using multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) shows that consumers tend to use both traditional offline information sources and online information sources when they shop online. However, the preference for different online and offline information sources is likely to be different for hedonic and utilitarian products. Individual factors, such as Internet usage experience, need for cognition and age, also tend to influence consumer preference for different online and offline sources. This has important implications for e-marketers as they may need to use different communication channels depending on the nature of the product and the characteristics of their target consumers to effectively promote their offerings. © 2017, 2017 K.J.

While the reference paper doesn't directly address sustainable or responsible consumption, it offers valuable insights into how consumers' network positions influence their information-seeking behavior. This could be relevant to your research in the following ways:

* **Contextualizing Information Seeking:** You could use the findings from this paper to contextualize the information-seeking processes of consumers interested in responsible consumption. For example, you could explore whether consumers with strong social networks (central positions) are more likely to seek information about ethical aspects of products compared to those with weaker networks (peripheral positions).
* **Identifying Information Sources:** The paper highlights the difference in information-seeking behavior between experts and novices. This could help you identify potential sources of information for consumers interested in responsible consumption. Are experts within specific networks (e.g., sustainability-focused communities) more influential in shaping information-seeking behaviors?
* **Understanding Network Effects:** The paper's focus on network positions could be useful for understanding how social influence and information diffusion within networks impact the adoption of responsible consumption practices.

**Important Note:**

It's crucial to critically evaluate the applicability of the reference paper's findings to your specific context.

While the reference paper focuses on online search behavior and information processing heuristics in a general consumer context, it offers some potentially valuable insights for your research on information-seeking and responsible consumption. 

Here's how you could potentially utilize it:

* **Understanding Search Types:** The paper's distinction between exploratory and directed search could be relevant to your study. You could explore whether consumers engaged in different types of information seeking when researching ethically responsible products. Do they tend towards exploratory searches to gain a broad understanding, or directed searches for specific ethical attributes?
* **Information Processing:** The paper's findings on the relationship between search behavior and information processing (alternative-based vs. attribute-based) might be helpful in understanding how consumers evaluate ethical aspects of products. Does a particular search type lead to a more thorough consideration of ethical attributes?
* **Website Design Implications:** The paper discusses website customization based on user search behavior. You could draw upon this to suggest how information systems and decision-support tools could be designed to better support responsible consumption by catering to different search types and information needs.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Contextual Differences:** Remember that the reference paper's context is broader consumer behavior, not specifically focused on sustainability or ethical consumption. You'll need to carefully consider how its findings might apply to your specific research area.
* **Limited Direct Relevance:** The paper doesn't directly address information barriers, asymmetries, or the impact of information availability on responsible consumption, which are key aspects of your study.

Overall, the reference paper offers some potentially useful insights into information-seeking behavior, but its relevance to your research is limited. You should use it cautiously and focus on the aspects that align with your specific research questions."

For this study, web survey was carried out between 1st November and 31st December 2009. Survey sample consisted of 251 respondents from various parts of Slovenia. The questionnaire was developed to analyse consumers' socio-demographic characteristics, monthly income and food purchase decision-making. The majority of respondents were male (76%) and held university degree (68%). The proportion of respondents with monthly income between 600 and 1,000 EUR was 41%. More than one third of respondents, of which 76% were female, reported their monthly food expenditure of over 200 EUR per family member. The largest share of respondents (43%) spent from 20 to 30% of their monthly income on food. In terms of search for food information, the respondents most frequently chose »friends and acquaintances«, »newspapers and magazines« and »web pages«, whereas option of »in-store food promotions« was chosen less often. In the area of consumers' inquisitiveness concerning food, responses suggested that participants were predominantly interested in food quality. Regarding food purchase decision-making, »familiar« and »Slovenian product« emerged as dominant factors, whereas product price was considered less important. Correlation analysis showed significant positive correlation between organic food production, organic product purchase and searching information on food from television and radio.

While the reference paper focuses on food purchasing in Slovenia, it does touch upon **information seeking behaviors** related to food choices.  

Here's how you could potentially utilize it:

* **Comparative Context:** You could briefly mention the Slovenian study as a point of comparison, highlighting how information sources used by Slovenian consumers (friends, acquaintances, newspapers, web pages) align with or differ from the information sources relevant to your study population.
* **Information Seeking Motivations:** The paper mentions that Slovenian consumers were ""predominantly interested in food quality."" This finding could be used to support your argument about the importance of accessible and transparent information in driving responsible consumption, as consumers clearly seek information to make informed choices about product quality.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Limited Scope:** The reference paper's focus on food purchasing in a specific country limits its direct applicability to your broader study on information-seeking and responsible consumption.
* **Dated Data:** The data is from 2009, which may not reflect current information-seeking trends and consumer behaviors.

Thus, stakeholders try to invest in green companies and projects; consumers prefer to buy eco-friendly products instead of traditional ones; and consumers and investors refuse to deal with unfair green companies. In this case, the companies should quickly adapt their strategy corresponding to the new trend of transformation from overconsumption to green consumption. This process leads to increasing the frequency of using greenwashing as an unfair marketing instrument to promote the company's green achievements. Such companies' behavior leads to a decrease in trust in the company's green brand from the green investors. Thus, the aim of the study is to check the impact of greenwashing on companies' green brand. For that purpose, the partial least-squares structural equation modeling (PLS-PM), content analysis and Fishbourne methods were used. The dataset for analysis was obtained from the companies' websites and financial and non-financial reports. The objects of analysis were Ukrainian large industrial companies, which work not only in the local market but also in the international one. The findings proved that a one point increase in greenwashing leads to a 0.56 point decline in the company's green brand with a load factor of 0.78. The most significant variable (loading factor 0.34) influencing greenwashing was the information at ocial websites masking the company's real economic goals. Thus, a recommendation for companies is to eliminate greenwashing through the publishing of detailed ocial reports of the companies' green policy and achievements. © 2020 by the authors.",Brand; Content analysis; Renewable energy; Sustainable development,Ukraine; alternative energy; consumption behavior; equation; least squares method; stakeholder; sustainability,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081657692,Yes,Asymmetries,"
This paper is relevant to your research because it directly addresses the issue of **information asymmetries** in the context of sustainable consumption.  

Specifically, the reference paper highlights how companies engage in **greenwashing**, which creates a disparity in information between the company (presenting a misleadingly green image) and consumers (who may not have access to the full truth about the company's environmental practices). This aligns with your interest in how information barriers can influence responsible consumption.

Here's how you can utilize this paper in your research:

* **Supporting Argument:** You can cite this paper to support your argument that information asymmetries, such as those created by greenwashing, can act as a barrier to responsible consumption.
* **Real-World Example:** The paper provides a concrete example of greenwashing and its negative impact on consumer trust. You can use this example to illustrate the challenges consumers face when trying to make informed decisions about sustainable products.
* **Expanding Discussion:** The paper's findings on the relationship between greenwashing and consumer trust could be incorporated into your discussion of the factors that influence the valuation of ethical aspects during decision-making. 


Remember to critically evaluate the paper's methodology and findings, and ensure they align with the scope and focus of your own research."
